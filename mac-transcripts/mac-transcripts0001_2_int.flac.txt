 Okay, yesterday, um, yeah, I woke up around a quarter to six, um, just went through my normal routine. Had a shower, um, just ironed a shirt, grabbed a cup of coffee, uh, got ready for work, went in and, um, I had a piece of toast with my cup of coffee, um, just prepared for my normal, set off to work for, um, before my normal, um, train trip. So I went down, uh, to the paper shop, grabbed the paper on the way to read on the train, walked down, walked down to the station and, um, the train was on time, been pretty reliable lately, so, uh, jumped on the train and headed into Parramatta, um, got to work, um, checked my emails, made a cup of coffee, checked my emails, went through those and just dealt with a few things, a few responses to messages that had come, come in the previous evening and then, uh, just attended to a couple of reports, um, I progressed those, um, till about 9.30, um, so that my boss is actually away at the moment on travel, so I had a new, new boss there for this week, so I just sort of caught up with him, gave him a briefing on what was happening, see if there's any, any issues and, uh, which then weren't, so I just, uh, basically went back and, uh, progressed a few reports, had a meeting with a couple of the project managers just to outline something that was coming up for next week, and so all that went fine, then I had to, I think by the time that I made a few further phone calls and finished a few reports, it was lunchtime, so I walked up, grabbed my subway and went back to work. In the afternoon I had a OH&S meeting, so I'd been delegated to go to that meeting regularly now, so that was with a couple of the other, uh, with a couple of the other, um, managers of different units in the same building, so that was okay, that was pretty painless, so, um, that sort of took me into the late afternoon, uh, just continued on with a couple of, uh, reports, I've got a couple of deadlines coming up, trying to get a few things finished before the boss gets back next week, though, um, finished off those, came about five o'clock, so I got on the, went up and got a train home, and that was, so that was the end of my, my working day, yeah. Okay, when I got home, um, uh, the kids were running around as usual, so just went and spoke to them and played with them a bit, uh, we went out the back and had a bit of a muck around, there's a problem with the, the pool filter at the moment, so I had a bit of a fiddle with that, tried to, tried to fix that, which without any luck, so I had to put in a maintenance call for that, it's only, it's only a few weeks old, so, um, by this time my wife was, um, was preparing some, some dinner, so I was, that was ready by, by this stage, and, um, so we sat down, had dinner, uh, the kids went on the computers for, for a little while, just, um, played around on their computers, uh, they, and by that stage I actually went back into, to my computer, and, like, there was just a few things I had to tidy up from, from yesterday, so just tidied those up, organized my, all my notes and files from the day, um, by that stage my wife was in bed watching TV, and I, not long after that, went to bed and went to sleep for the night. What did we have for dinner? We had, it was like a, um, shepherd's pie with vegetables, yeah, on the subway, um, it was, uh, chicken, chicken strips, yeah, I just tasted a bit of Vegemite, no, I didn't actually catch the bus, I caught, I caught the train, yeah, uh, very rarely, never to work, no, no. When you got into work? Uh, it was about 7.30, no, that's, that's not true, you must be mistaken, I must have been walking into the building from, from somewhere else, a meeting or something, um, well, my normal routine gets me there at that time each morning, and yesterday I was on time, basically, yeah, it was not long after I arrived, um, yeah, the filling boss, the acting boss for the week, uh, yes, yeah, that was later on in the morning, no, it was just with the, with the actual managers, the project managers, uh, two, uh, it was actually a chicken, chicken strips, chicken strips, yeah, no, I didn't, I would have to have mined it occasionally, uh, I was an OH&S, yeah, uh, it was more like about, I think it was about five-ish, yeah, about five o'clock, uh, I got the train home, no, I didn't, uh, no, I played with the kids, actually, no, we do have a dog, the dog was running around, but I played, no, I played with the kids, yeah, I didn't install it, it was, it was broken, so I just, it wasn't working properly, so I just attempted to try and get it working, nah, that's, that's, that's not true, I don't know where that, where that came from, it didn't occur, yes, I do, oh, the train ticket won't, no, no, it's just a train ticket, that's the right train ticket for the right train, oh, I walked down, no, no, I never catch the bus to work, no, no, no, I wasn't, oh, I had a brief discussion, yes, yes, no, no, I don't, there was no incident on the bus yesterday, I wasn't involved in any incident, yeah, I don't know where that come from, that's right, um, oh, I could verify it, if I had verified, verified if I had to, yeah, I mean, there'd be evidence of, of that, right, well, I just f***ing verified, whereI was, I can't verify where I wasn't, sure.
