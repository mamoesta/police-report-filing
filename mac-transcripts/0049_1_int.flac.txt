 Okay, so what do I have to say about that? I'm out of bed. That was good. I wondered why my wife wasn't out of bed. Then I did my usual shower and shave and things. It was very early because I've given my daughter my car. Which means I'm on the bus. Which means I'm getting up half an hour earlier than usual. Which is my most vivid memory from the morning. As indeed today. Because I've given my car to my daughter. Which is very big of me. But now I'm back on the bloody bus. I've got to buy another one. Refer to exercise one. So then what did I do? Then I ate a very uninteresting breakfast. And caught the bus to work. And threw myself headlong into my work. Which is at the moment. Checking whether or not the answers to exam questions. In police promotional exams are right. And I found two that were definitely wrong. So it's not a waste of time. Which is nice. And also I'm looking at data for our HR project. I'm looking at all the data held by our human resources. Across three different sections. And it's huge. It sounds like a small project. But actually it's big. And as well I'm doing promotions. And wreaking havoc in a number of other areas at the same time. Got home. Went for a walk. About 6km. Then read and fell in a heap. Had dinner there somewhere too. Poor old wife was sick. But she's feeling better. She should be at work today. So what time did I get up yesterday? 5.40. 5.40 I get up. I usually get up half an hour later. This is my great act of altruism with the car. What did we have? We just had wheat bix and toast. Oh, avocado. I think avocado on sourdough bread is one of life's delights. Oh, that was a bus. A government bus. From Eastwood to Parramatta. Something I drive in about 5 minutes takes 35. Hence I have to get up half an hour earlier. It's free. 7.30. Same as this morning. So what time do we have lunch? 12.30. 12.30 is lunch. What did I have for lunch here? Yesterday. No, no. I just brought a chicken sandwich with me. Yeah, we had people over Sunday. And some leftovers, which was nice. We had a French day on Sunday. Yeah, my wife's French and we had the French relatives over from New Caledonia. So we had the big French day on Sunday. So what time do we leave? About quarter to four. I think I'd had enough. Yeah, bus back home. Yep. So I would have got home at 4.20, which is half an hour later than usual. Yep, six days at least. Every day. So that would have been quarter to seven. Yeah, what did we have? Couscous. Couscous. And tomato. Tomato con casse. What was that? And jambon and charcuterie. Cold meats in English. Yep. That would have been about quarter to ten, I think. I'm definitely not a night owl. God, it's aging. It's terrible, isn't it? I'm reading a book called Unbroken, which is actually a biography that I found on the internet. I just googled Best Nonfiction 2010 and this was one of the top five to come up. So being a ceaseless reader, I bought this book Unbroken and it's actually about an Italian. In 1940, we were actually to be held in Tokyo, believe it or not, but not surprisingly, they were cancelled and he was drafted into the army. John Kennedy became quite a war hero in the Pacific. Not that I'm really a war buff, but it's certainly excellently written by the same woman, Laura Hildebrand, who wrote Seabiscuit, that was made into a movie and all sorts of other things. But it's just an excellently readable biography, just in the light entertainment sort of category, I suppose you'd call it. No, never do. Not often. Well, not often. I probably look to see if there was something on SBS and if there's nothing, that's the end of it. No, I never get Foxtel. Pay me to watch it, I think. Brody. Brody, yep. That was the bus. That was a 545 bus from Eastwood to Parramatta. Yep. Cereal, Weet-Bix, toast and avocado. 7.30. 7.30. Only takes half an hour to get here. Nah, never. Yes, yes, promotion exams, yep. HR data project, 12.30 for lunch. Yeah, something like that. Yes, yep. Tomorrow, otherwise it's too dry. Yep. No, it wasn't. No, that was quite well. That was modest, modest. Modest budget. Good god, it's the day before payday, Morial. We're not going to get too extravagant. Yep. Quarter to four. Yep, quarter to four. No, never. 6K walk. That's right. No, don't. I find if I jog, I can't breathe. Yep, that'll be it. Quarter to seven. Quarter to seven. No. Too late. No, the children would be eating the furniture by then. Unbroken. Unbroken. It's called unbroken, yep. No, nonfiction. That's nonfiction. Definitely nonfiction. Probably had a look to see if there was something on SBS. As I said earlier, I speak French and German, bit of Italian and Russian, so I usually look to see if there's a good European show or movie on SBS, but there probably wasn't. Maybe one night a week you get a little gem, but that's about it. Cold meats and, what did we have? Couscous. Couscous and tomato con cas. Con cas, which is sort of parsley and olive oil and garlic mixed in with the tomato. It's an old French thing my wife does. It's just delightful. Simplest things are the best. Yes, at about quarter to ten, that's right. Yep. The colleague's drunk. Maybe he hasn't changed his watch for daylight saving. Hang on, the rest of us have gone forward, so if he had... No, hang on, it'd be back, it'd be the other way. Then he'd be two hours out, wouldn't he? Okay, alright. So much for that theory. Alright, well maybe he just lives in New Zealand and he hasn't adjusted his watch. Can I verify that I start at 7.30? Yes I can. I can verify by the time I walked into the building that it'd be an entry pass. And we have had to check those for people at some stage. And also you can look at the time that they log on to the network with their computer. Well, they're drunk too. No, I don't think so. No, I think their times are a little bit silly. The time I log on to the network was 8.30. Good God, did it take me an hour to make a cup of coffee? I really am getting slow in my old age. There is a surprisingly large number of people at work when I get there. Ahh, well I'll supply their names. So you want some names? So we can say, I can see. This is like romper room and I can see. Okay, how's our interview going? Are we doing questions? Ready, set, go. Ok. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment.
