 Yesterday I had to get up extra early because our shower's been playing up and we never really know if there's going to be hot water or not. So I got up early and the hot water wasn't working. So then I had to go outside with a toolbox and a torch and bang on the shower until I could hear the thermostat working. And then wait two hours so we had hot water so that we could have a shower. And my dog's been kicking up the lawn so we spent all day at the shop fixing the lawn, trying to patch it all up and teach the dog not to dig up the lawn. The dog then ate all of the fertilizer that we put in the hole so we had to take her to the vet because she had had a bit of a bad reaction to it. So then we spent a few hours at the vet wondering how she was going to go. And after that we came home, we took our other dog for a walk which was really nice because it's finally getting warm in the afternoon. And that was about it. That took up our whole day. About four. In the morning? Mm-hmm. And then you went home? I had some diet yogurt yesterday. It was actually pretty good. It was Valia lemon sorbet. It tastes like dessert. No, it's very strange. And how did you drive? I drove. Did you have lunch? Yep. I had some leftover pork belly from dinner the night before. My partner does all the cooking because I'm really crap in the kitchen. So I always manage to get some leftovers. I don't know, he refuses to eat leftovers. So I'd get dibs for lunch the next day. I finished at quarter to four. No, I drove home as well. And the traffic was horrible. So I sat in traffic for a couple of hours. But I've got Bluetooth in my car now so I can call people and chat which is good instead of just sitting there. So then after- We had tacos for dinner. Yogurt, diet yogurt. You didn't have any toast? I love toast but I'm on a diet so no toast. Why do you want to do it? Well, it's work. I couldn't fit into my jeans anymore so. So do you ever- No. No. To get to work by six at Ashfield, I've got to be on the train. I've got to get up at three to be on the four o'clock train to get me to Ashfield by six. So it's worthwhile in the afternoon because it only takes an hour to get home. But in the morning, I just can't get up at three o'clock in the morning. So you've got- No. I've got a dog, two dogs. Yeah, I'm allergic. So I look at the- We watch the Cats 101 on telly and I pick out all these cats that I want. It's on Foxtel. Like they road test all these cats and I really like the exotic. I think they look really funny. Is that on Animal Crossing? Yeah, I think so. I think- Yeah, something like that. That was all made up. So for dinner, you had- Tacos? No. No steak. And then work- No, I should have gone for a bike ride but instead I took the dogs- Oh, the dogs for a walk. You watched a- I can't remember what we did last night. Normally, I fall asleep on the couch after work. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I can't remember what we did last night. But on the weekend, we did watch the Amanda Knox movie. The Amanda Knox, that lady that was accused of murder in Italy and just got let off. We watched that movie. Very interesting. I'd love to know how much is fact or how much is fiction one day, I suppose. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment.
