 Saturday right okay um I've just moved into my daughter's flat at Stanmore I'm house sitting while she's away so I moved in there on the Friday night and on Saturday morning I really don't remember so I'm gonna have to try and remember got up and fed the cat which is the reason why I'm in the house in the first place and which meows constantly so I've now realized that I'm going to have to make sure that I keep the lounge room door closed so the cat can't get into the bedroom and of course place wasn't left to my standard so I spent most of the morning cleaning the kitchen cleaning out the cupboard throwing out things rearranging stuff so she's gonna get back home and she's not going to be happy with me but that's okay I'm sure she expects me to do that being a mother and all I then went for a walk up to up to Newtown to go get some groceries because of course she wouldn't have left any food in the fridge for her mother I then went looking for a gift for my nephew who was having his first dollar communion on Sunday so I wanted to get something holy I went into the shop and all I had stuff for Buddhism they didn't have any crosses or Christ like images anywhere so then I went back home had lunch and then I got ready to go because I knew of a place at Marrickville where they sold lots of little nicky-nacky things like that that I wanted and I was hoping upon hope that I would be able to get something there so I drove over to Marrickville parked in Silver Street walked up to this little gift store and anyway I was looking for a cross and they had all these crosses in there that but they're a bit feminine looking and I didn't think that they would be suitable for him and or they were a bit too big sort of more manish than boyish then I found this one in the cabinet that they had it was a little silver cross and it had black onyx on the front as well but it had fine little fine silver chain attached to it which I thought was a little bit too feminine the silver chain so I said to this Chinese lady who was serving me did you have do you have any of the black leather and she said yes so she got the bag out and there though there's all these the leather straps in there with the class five dollars on the bag and so I'm going to put it on to the into the cross and it wouldn't fit but she said that's okay she can make it fit but I have to make sure that that's what I want before she does it I said fine so she's taken out the silver chain and I've held it up and it looks good yep okay I want it so she said you can have the black band black leather thing for free and I said oh that's nice thank you very much and I said plus I want the silver chain she said I don't know I'll keep the silver chain I said but this is a silver chain it's be worth more than what the black band would be worth wouldn't it you just want to keep it because it's worth more and she said oh but it's too fine it's too fine for the cross I said it's no it's too fine for the cross but it's more expensive than your black thing I want to keep the silver chain as well thank you she said all right then well I'll have to change charge you for the black thing it'll be $8 I said no it's not $8 it's $5 it's got on the bag it's $5 she said but $3 for labor I said what you're gonna charge me $3 labor I said forget the labor I'll do it myself I got all upset and then I said to her that is really mean and it's not very good customer service for you to be doing that I said after I'm buying I'm spending $40 on the cross you tried to keep my silver chain and now you want to charge me $3 for labor you know that's just really not very nice and I eyeballed over for a little minute and she said all right I'll do it for free can you believe some people anyway then so then I go to the bottle shop pick up I picked up some green ginger wine and then I went drove to Lidcombe to visit some friends over there for a barbecue and there was a girly couple there who a year ago had committed like a marriage sort of a thing to each other that in a year's time they would formalize it so that was their anniversary so we did signing of the stat dec and we celebrated that and then I got home and went to bed oh I would have got home about 11 11 o'clock no I would have fed the cat otherwise I would have had crying cat yeah and I also had mozzies I had to fix that up as well hmm but I did feed the cat yes I did not really but I think I would have had to have because she would have been crying if I didn't so I would have yes I can say yes positive no would have been about for 830 mmm Stanmore yes I know two weeks yeah cat no she doesn't have a dog oh we had a family dog wasn't hers per se then my mum's dog she treated it what's her own yeah she's just no not since she's moved away no no no no dog just the cat Eve our new town town yeah oh what did I have to learn okay you know I can't really remember would have been oh actually it was sardines on toast which I didn't like and I also gave a little bit of leftovers to the cat who didn't really like it so I won't be buying them anymore there are mega three you know marigold yes I have been sinned and poor yes I have I went to the lawn bowls there's a bowling club there initially I was outraged it was like a how dare you forget it I'll do it myself I was I thought that was really poor customer service and I thought she was just trying to rip me off no I just think I perhaps my voice was raised but I didn't abuse her I just explained how disappointed I was in the fact that that was how she was treating her customers last for long not at all no no no not at all no and her husband was nearby sitting at the counter as well and didn't intervene at all so I felt then that he he possibly was on my side because he didn't say anything no no and her and husband no yes I agree that I did do that but it was only for like five seconds enough to say enough for me to express my disappointment in in her behavior actually it started off because I was upset because she was wanting to charge me three dollars for high for labor but then when I I sort of softened my approach and I explained to her that I thought that that was not very good customer service and you know not very nice way to be treated and I come down and she agreed and gave it to me for nothing I know no the only thing is I said was I said to her is it I forget it I could do it myself no no name-calling wrong people name no would it be more like 11 no not that night I was too tired after my exhausting day no no television in the bedroom mm-hmm no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no
