 Yep, I had to get up early yesterday because my mum and dad were down mid-north coast for the weekend and I had to drop my dad out to Richmond to pick up my brother's car so he could take it back home with him. So I left home about 8.30 I think, drove out to Richmond with my dad and my nephew, dropped dad off and then I drove back home with my nephew and then just hung around at home all day, had some lunch, went up to the shops, did some groceries, came home, watched a bit of the Sound of Music, cooked some dinner, ate, went to bed. That's about it. About 9.30, it's early last night so I'm not sure why I'm yawning. No, not last night, there was nothing on so I turned it off. It's just ironing and whatnot. Yep, sausages and mashed potato and vegetables. Sorry? Yeah, it was good. Oh, it was on a DVD, a Blu-ray that I've got. Just to the IGA up the road? No, I just had to grab some sausages and some milk and yogurt for the week. Oh, just ham sandwiches yesterday? No, I just had ham. About 11.30? Yep. About an hour? Yes, on the way there I did. Oh, which freeway? No. On the way home I did. So on the way there we went M2, M7 and on the way home I came back down Windsor Road and the M4. What, old Windsor Road? No, my mum and dad's. Yeah. Yes, yes. No, he was driving it home to his house. Yep. Yes. No? No, I don't think so. No. I didn't, I was not that far. I didn't get on the M4 until off James Rees Drive and then headed towards the city. Yeah, Parramatta? No. No. Well, it wasn't me. No, I didn't see cyclists. At all? No. No. I didn't know that. Oh, actually now that you mention it, I think I might have got out to speak to one of them but I didn't hit anyone. No, I didn't really look. I just saw one of them on the road so I got out to talk to them. No, just that they had a sore knee. No, I don't remember that. No. No. Yep, that's right. I didn't buy bread. No. No. No. Oh, I did actually. Yep. Apples and bananas. Yeah, I got yogurt. It was a mixed pack. I think it had strawberry, passion fruit and some other flavour. Uh, twenty past seven. No, I just had made myself a coffee. Yep. Yep. I haven't had it for years. I think so. I don't really remember. Years ago, when I was a kid. I don't remember. Yeah, I don't know. Oh, is it? I don't know. Yes. Yep. Oh, it was about 7.30 I think. I lose track of the time with daylight saving. No, I did some ironing. About 9.30 last night. No, sausages, veggies and mash. Yeah, they were like little chipolatas but there was chicken and lime and pork, ginger and shallot and then there were beef ones as well but I didn't eat the beef ones. Oh, you get the, they're like in individual packs but we got three different flavours. Um, chicken, lime and Asian herb. Delicious. But the pork ones were my favourite. Ginger and shallots. They're nice. You can get them from Woolworths or RGA. They're just in like peppercorn company or something. Peppercorn tree company. Yeah, they're good. Tasty, low fat. Because I don't normally like sausages. Yeah, but these ones are nice. Yeah, cevapies without the skin. Those ones? Yeah, they're good. Yeah.They're good on the barbie. Yeah they're really delicious.
