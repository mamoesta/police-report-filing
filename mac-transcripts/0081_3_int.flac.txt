 Okay yesterday was what day of the week would have been a Thursday I believe so of a Thursday I would have got up because I'm kind of homeless now because I'm homeless and I don't come from my normal place I'm now really trying to work out what's the best way to get to work. I did think about trying the public transport option but the public transport option didn't quite work for me on Sunday. So where I am I thought I'll jump onto Victoria Raid and I see this Metro bus stop and I think fabulous and the first bus that goes past is the Dromoyne bus the M50 like that's not the bus I need but fabulous at least I know it's a bus stop and it's here and I'm looking for a Paramount bus so I can come to the headquarters building. The next bus to come here's the I wait about 10 minutes and there's the M52 bus going to Paramount fabulous I wave it down and it just drives straight on past me and I'm thinking okay that's really annoying. So I then realized that there's another bus stop about no maybe 300 meters up quite a steep hill and that's the bus stop I actually need to go to in order to catch the M52 bus because the M50 stops here but the M52 stops up there which is of course typical because if I needed one bus stop out of the two then it's the one that's furthest from me that I have to go to. So having not been so successful with the public transport option I thought you know what I'm just going to drive. So I ended up driving and of course I need to get to early because we're running a few exercises in the morning kicking off at eight o'clock so I catch a I catch a I drive in at 6 30 and I go past a coffee shop that I know is convenient for me to park right outside of and go and get a coffee. Of course it was shut I mean seriously what kind of coffee shop doesn't open at 6 30 in the morning when people really need a coffee driving to work in Sydney. Given the fact that most people need a good half an hour an hour to get to work the commute a cup of coffee the size of a bucket is generally about what you need to start the day. So not being able to go to that coffee shop and then go to another coffee shop that is on a main road and I managed to pull over there and well they now have my business. So I finally get to work and I get to work at about sort of you know the 8 30 time slot and everything seems to be going tickety-boo things have kicked off. Thankfully I'm not required to participate in the training exercises so I'm actually a little bit more freed up to do with what I need to do in the day. So what was that? Oh yes that's right 80% of my job is making the boss look good 20% of my job is actually my job so yes whenever whenever the boss needs and I get that done nothing particularly interesting or exciting yesterday bit of running around you know need to go get a photo developed that we took a group photo of when I came to work on that Sunday that I couldn't catch the bus. So do you just go and ask them to develop 25 photos straight away because what if it doesn't quite come out clear and focus when you actually print it out that could actually be a bit annoying. So I'm thinking whether I should just print out one photo now and then wait till that one photo to be good then I'll say right can I have 24 more or you know I'm not quite sure the best way to go about doing that. Yesterday also was lunch was about 12 30 and we had leftover lunch from the catering that we had during the day so lunch was with the receptionist and so that was pleasant enough. More I guess mundane work throughout the afternoon it's really quite of a nothing day mainly cleaning up a lot of emails chasing up a lot of phone calls and nothing much particularly significant or interesting happening throughout the day. The day would have wrapped up approximately 4 4 30 at which point I actually then caught or I drove myself back into the city in order to go and participate in a fitness training session. So that was pleasant enough that kicked off at six o'clock but I drove home and then I had to catch a bus into the city to get to the domain. Now if you've never really caught a bus before to get into the city it's really hard to know which bus you're meant to catch where does the bus actually stop or more particularly how do you catch a bus to get home. So it actually took me quite a little while to work out the exact places where the bus actually stops which are the various bus numbers that I am able to catch to take me to that stop how much does a ticket cost because am I still classed as being in the zone one or am I now zone two do you just buy a one-off ticket or do you buy a travel 10 what's a travel 10 how much does a travel 10 for zone one cost as opposed to a zone two um where do I buy how often do buses turn up there's all these millions of questions and it's like and I was talking to someone who was also going to a similar place to catch a bus and she's like yeah your bus comes every 10 minutes you can buy travel 10s from the news agents uh zone one will probably get you this far but you might be a zone two and like a myriad of questions because you catch the bus all the time but I'm thinking you know what for someone doesn't actually catch public transport very often it's not the easiest system to navigate so uh welcome to this city people complain about traffic parking or public transport pick two out of three they're the things that people primarily complain about I think I'm happiest when I complain about the traffic because at least my car I know it's comfortable if I feel like singing and listening to music I can do that if I feel like listening to talkback radio I can do that and uh that was fine uh the I was home by about sort of 7 30. Uh in fact I actually forewent for now forewent or foregoed I foregoed dinner I forewent dinner I must have a look at that because that actually foregoed doesn't sound right I foregone dinner that doesn't sound right either oh I must look into that mental night must ask Amanda about use of the past tens of foregone okay uh so yes so bedtime was about 10 o'clock last night because I had to wake up at 10 to 5 this morning to drive a person to the airport which is always a fantastically fun thing to do so yes that was a bit about my day yesterday no no I forewent dinner forewent foregone I drove uh I drove to Balmain to drop off my car and then from Balmain I jumped into a bus to went to go to the city that's correct I drove to Balmain I dropped my car off there picked up my workout gear and drove into the city caught a bus into the city so it was a pretty full bus so I did what I thought was the right thing which was to actually get up and offer a place to an old lady who got on board the bus the bus was fairly full I'm curious does that lady is she allowed to then complain about the amount of personal space she has when I have nowhere else to go I got up and I gave her the seat what more can I do oh you know just kind of yeah because I'm well I've literally just stood up beside the seat to let her sit down and I actually physically had nowhere else to go so I was kind of just hovering over the top of her because I had nowhere else to go yes so it was a full bus and so you know I'm just wondering does she have the right to complain about the amount of personal space I'm giving her I don't think that I think the answer is no but hey that's just my personal opinion I'm a full fair paying passenger just like she is no no it was uh looks and glances that was like hmm you're kind of hovering over me like yes yes I am because the bus is full I have nowhere else I can physically go no I didn't because I'm actually I was running through the question in my head about what the protocol is about personal space when I actually was nice enough to give her the seat in the first place mental note see don't be nice see people they're just no good no I did not although I did have a few choice words going through my head if she persisted in giving me looks about the amount of personal space she was getting no on the way home I actually just wandered the city to find the appropriate buses that could potentially take me back to where I am like I said I had no idea about the area where I'm where I now live because I'm homeless there is no train station in Balmain although I have known people who catch sometimes trains to central and maybe get off at central and catch a bus I don't know that's again I don't quite know how the interactions between buses and trains work in this city it's a little bit convoluted well Balmain has a wharf but I think it's actually part of a river although it would technically be on Parramatta River but still considered as part of the harbour area as opposed to a river the river cut is a direct express from Parramatta the city doesn't stop there but there are other services that it does stop at potentially I could but I imagine that I would need to catch a ferry from Parramatta to the city and then a separate ferry from the city to Balmain and the ferry is a lovely way to travel but it actually costs twice as much takes twice as long it's just that it's much more pleasant yesterday I would have woken up at about 7 30 I did drive in no ah no 6 30 the coffee shop was shut so I must have left a little bit later because I was looking for an open coffee shop I didn't want to have to do that drive again without a cup of coffee this time no I left home at 7 30 I would have got up at 6 30 no if I left at 7 30 I would have got into work a bit after 8 yeah so I was on my list of things to do to get 25 photos printed of a class that we had I know the same photo printed 25 times except I need to buy frames fill them and I need to add names and it's just a little bit complicated really can't I just email people photos and they can do with it what they will my boss wants 25 photos printed 80 of my job is making the boss look good uh it's for me although I cannot recall because done by 20 of the staff we have five staff members I do most of the work how that rule works for the other four clearly I finished work about 4 30 and I caught I drove home and then caught a bus from home to the city I went to bed around about 10 o'clock and only four went to dinner no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment No comment.
