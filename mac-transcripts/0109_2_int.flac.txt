 Yesterday, okay, yesterday I woke up about 5.30, turned on the kettle, had a shower, got dressed, had breakfast. Breakfast consisted of a cup of tea and a bowl of porridge. Finished getting dressed, left, drove to the railway station, caught the train to Parramatta, commence work. Don't really have lunch but it's eat bits and pieces as you go. Had a cup of coffee in the morning, that would have been about, estimated about 9 o'clock. Had a snack probably about 9.30, also had a piece of fruit about the same time. And a sandwich was eaten at the desk at about 1, 1.30. And at about 10 past 5 I left work to travel home via train just after 6, 7.30.
