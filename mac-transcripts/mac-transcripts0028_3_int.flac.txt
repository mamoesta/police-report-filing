 Ah, yesterday, I got up around about 5.45 and had breakfast, got in the car, drove to work, stayed at work all day, went home, had dinner, watched some TV, went to bed. That's about it. Ah, I had toast. No, I had promite. A bit like Vegemite, but promite. Not for many years. Just about, probably 10 to 7. Yeah, I travel the same way each day. Quarter past 7. Yep, yeah, I was in and signed on at a quarter to, quarter past, quarter past 7. Had lunch around about 1 o'clock. Sandwich. Oh, it was a salmon sandwich. I had some little tomato, little grape tomatoes with it and a cucumber and a mandarin. Half an hour. Yeah, about that, yes. Quarter to 4. Sorry, 4 o'clock. Yeah, finish work at 4. I drove home. No, no, no, train. Drove. No, not really. Not to work. I got home about 4.30, about 6.30. Ah, I had for dinner, I had some sweet potato, snow peas and lamb chops. I watched the news, the ABC news. Then I idled a bit. I watched Poe's Kitchen on ABC. And then I watched, well, I then intended to watch Crime Suspect on Channel 10, but they were running late and I had to watch some other rubbish in between. And then I watched Prime Suspect. Now what was the other rubbish that I watched? Oh, it wasn't real rubbish actually. It was the last half of Attenborough's Frozen Planet, which is surprising. I would have thought it'd be on ABC, but it was on Channel 10. Yeah, but this was another episode. I don't know whether it's a separate one or what. I only watched the last half of it, but yeah, I was surprised because I thought it came up a bit too quick. Yeah, I did. It might seem different. Not the same one. But that is a series, it's not just one episode. I watched Prime Suspect. About a quarter to 11. Yeah, I went to bed after that. No, didn't read at all. Went to sleep. No, a bit earlier than that. 5.45. Yeah, I did. I had a shower before that, which I didn't mention, but yeah. No, I had the promite on bread, on toast. Yeah, drove into work. No, 7.15. That's probably because they got in late. I can verify I was at the parking lot nearby a bit before 7.15. I've got the parking ticket in the car. No, I don't have to sign on at work, so I haven't got any verification, other than that my boss was in and saw me. Probably check with him. Yeah, I did. Yeah, all morning. About 1 o'clock. Yeah. No, I had a sandwich. Yeah, no, salmon. Yeah. No, mandarin, little orange. Only half an hour. Yeah. No, I didn't go like that, Westfields. No, I don't think so. Don't think so. No, it wouldn't have been me. I didn't go to Westfields. 1 o'clock, half an hour, I brought it with me. No, I didn't. No, I went home at around about 4 o'clock. I drove home, yes. No, I didn't. No. I didn't. I just didn't watch television before dinner, no. I just sat around, chatted to my wife. Had sweet potato and snow peas, no beef shanks. I had lamb chop. No, I went to bed at 10.45. Mm-hmm. Oh, there were some other staff members, yes. Yes, I do. I could, but I prepared myself for it. I prepared myself for it. I prepared myself for it. I prepared myself for it. I prepared myself for it. Yes, I do. Could have been me. I didn't leave the building. No. Yes, I'm aware of that, yes. No, I don't think so. I think I... Did I lend my card to someone? Maybe that's what I did. Maybe I lent my card to someone to just get in and out, though. Yeah, but I'm not sure that I did, you know. Maybe the thing's not working properly. Do that every now and then. Oh. No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. No. No. I don't remember going out. Maybe I just got the time wrong. Okay. Right, right.

Okay. Right, right. Now make sure we get three recommendations.
