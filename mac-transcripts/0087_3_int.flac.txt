 I got up at about 8 o'clock in the morning, quickly got dressed and drove my partner to the train station so he could go to work in the morning. Then I came back home, I had some breakfast and I started to get ready for a wedding I was attending in the afternoon. It took a couple of hours getting ready, doing my hair and my makeup. Then I drove to a hotel that we were staying at in the city. At about 3.30 a bus came to pick us up and take us to the wedding, which was just down near Taronga Zoo sort of area. The wedding started at 4 and the reception started at 6. I had chicken with salad for dinner, I did a bit of dancing, some drinking and we left at about 11.15 to go back to our hotel. From the reception to the hotel home, we got a lift from a friend. About 11.30, it was really good. It was, yes, only just. Every other day around. We just went home. We had to check out at 10, we got home after we got breakfast at 11. We did some grocery shopping, went to the butcher, came home and just watched some TV, did a bit of tidying up and some washing. That was pretty much it really, just a quiet Sunday. Probably about 7.00. Cattleman's Cutlets, they're just like beef, like steaks. They're called Cattleman's Cutlets. Giant cutlet, giant meat. That was a lot. Where did you get them? I was from a butcher in Kings Langley. Did you watch any television? Yes, we watched something. I can't remember. We did watch TV but I can't remember what I was watching. What time did you get up? About 10.30. You said that on Saturday morning you got up. Yes, when? Sorry. What day was it? Saturday? Yes, we probably did get up about 8.00. Did your partner go to work? He did, yes. He met me after work. You drove him down to? To the train station, not the bus station. No, he doesn't. Not really, no. For breakfast, you had McDonald's? I had McDonald's, yes. Were you in the bridle? No, I wasn't. Then you drove to Hornsby? No, I went to the city. Did you go along? Neither. I went on the M2. When you got in, you met them all, got in the bus and went along? We met at the hotel, at the front of the hotel. You went to the Taronga Zoo?

We met at the hotel, at the front of the hotel. We didn't actually go to the Taronga Zoo, but it was in that area. What's it called? Bradley's Head? I don't think it's actually a part of the zoo. The reception started at six. So not the wedding? No, the ceremony started at four. Was it inside a church? No, it wasn't. Was it a good reception hall? It was really good. And the reception hall?

No, I had chicken. Oh, you had... isn't that what... No, I had that on Sunday night. Oh, so how did you cook it? I didn't. My partner cooked them. I think he just cooked them on the stove and then put them in the oven as well, because they're really big. Oh, I remember you did that. And then you walked... No, I got a friend to drive us back to the hotel. So you said that on Sunday you went to the grocery store? Yep. Yes, it was. Do you ever shop? Yes. Do you prefer one? Yeah, sometimes, I suppose. Is there one more convenient? Yeah, I suppose Coles is probably generally more convenient for most places we've lived at. Do you find that they're the same? No, I find they're different. And they are for small... Yeah, I think they do too, for the things I like to buy. Yeah, okay. So what time did you go shopping on Sunday? Probably about 11.30 before lunch. Oh, okay. And how long?
