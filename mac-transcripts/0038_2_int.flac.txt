 Oh yeah, I had the day off. I took the little one to the doctors at Epping, and then I took him to school. Then I went to the shops, picked up a few things, had a nice time at the shops. And then I got back home to help my husband prepare for the EP week next week. We did about an hour and a half to two hours on that. Then I did some housework, got things done. And then the kids started to come home. And then by and large, yeah, it was a good evening. We had a nice dinner. I picked the little one up at five because she went to a friend's house. And we watched telly, my favorite show. And then we all went to bed. Nine. Seven. Oh, we had chicken and vegetables. No, I'd bought, it comes with pastry around it. It's a bit of pre-made and I just have to cook it. 6.30. He had to be there at eight. I got to school 9.30. 20 minutes? No, sorry, I went to the shops. No, just bits and pieces, Medicare and different things. Probably an hour and a half. Yeah, probably more like 12. I just had nuts, I think. Out of a bag. Well, by that time, John was getting a bit annoyed about his study. So I just thought I'll sit here and eat a bag of nuts. I won't move because otherwise he'll go. He gets very tense about next week. No, he'd been home. He'd been home. Yeah, so I don't know what he ate. Just washing, lots of washing. No, the two boys came home on the bus. Yeah, and I went and got the little one. Five. No, from a friend's house. They took it home with them. Yeah, friend's mother, yeah. That's right, yeah. Well, that was a funny thing. And then we had to go back because we left a school bag back there. And it was a half an hour by the time we'd come home. It was only up the road. Yeah, it was wet. I had the stupid dog with me to get her out of the house. Yeah, anyway, we dropped all the school bags on the road. It was wet. Yeah, no, no, no, we walked. The whole thing was a walk. Up the road. No, just up the road. Yeah, yeah. Oh, it's only 400 meters up the road. 500 meters. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no. Like, that couldn't have happened. There was no man. No man, didn't see anyone. No, no, no one else was silly enough to walk in the rain. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, two? No, not really. No, no, no, yeah, no. Half past five? Oh, oh, well, I had all the kids there, so it would have been unpacking, probably more washing. Oh, getting the dinner. On and ready, yeah. No, I don't think I did any ironing. Yeah, no, because it was wet. Seven, I think. No, chicken and veggies. We don't ever. No, yeah, I did. The geeks, yeah. No, sometimes, yeah. No, more like nine. You wouldn't know it. Yeah, because that's what happens. So, seven? A couple of times, probably, yeah. A couple of times. Twice? Yeah, he does. Sort of, yeah. No comment, no comment, no comment, no comment.
