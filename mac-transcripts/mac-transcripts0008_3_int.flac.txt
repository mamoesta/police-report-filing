 Yesterday I woke up early. I guess waking up early regularly makes my days off hard to sleep in. So I probably got up about 6.30. I cleaned the house. It was a really nice day. So I got to do a bit of cleaning outside as well. And then started packing and went up the coast because a friend of mine was getting married. So my partner and I drove up to our friend's house. She lives not too far from where the wedding was and we stayed at her place overnight. And we had a drink and got ready with her and then went to the wedding. The wedding was at a surf club right on the beach. It was so pretty and spectacular weather. So we were there from about 4 until midnight. We got kicked out. There's no phone reception, no mobile phone reception down there because it's on the coast but it's in a gully almost. And so we were standing outside trying to ring for a taxi and couldn't get through. But thankfully there were some other people that had ordered a taxi. And it was a really big one. There was only 5 of them. And it was like a mini bus and so they let us hitch a ride with them. And they were going different places and the bus driver couldn't drop us off to where we needed to go. So instead we just went to where they went. And then we went to his next pick up. Got let out. He got his new pick up, took them somewhere and then came back, picked us up and then took us home. So it took 2 hours to get home which made it less fun. But we had a bottle of wine with us so we coped quite well. 2.30 where we were staying the first time. At some hotel somewhere in the city, in the town. No yogurt? No. It's beautiful. We drive. In my car. Yeah, it was good though. There was no crowds or anything. I wouldn't have thought that having it at a surf club would be nice. I thought it would be a bit trashy but upstairs they've got a function room and it looks right out over the beach. That was spectacular. 4.15. Yep. Last Sunday we were staying at our friend's place. We'd been out for a big night the night before. So we had a good sleep in, all got ready and went to breakfast at some Spanish cafe. We had a late breakfast there and then they dropped us off at our cars and we drove home. And then we got home and just retired to the couch or a CD. I can never remember what I ate. Oh, I had an omelette. A Spanish omelette. Oh, I'm not sure. Probably 12. It was more brunch I suppose. Yep. Yep. It took about two hours. I must have been about... yeah. Um, I don't know. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. No. I wasn't anywhere near Smith Street. No. No. Um, about two months old. No, not that I've seen. This morning. No, it wasn't me. At about 1.30 I would have been on the freeway from Newcastle. F3 I think it's... No. Nope. No, I didn't know that. It was me! No, it wasn't me. No. Nope. No. No. It's parked in Ashfield. No. No. In the garage. Yeah. Um, my partner. Mm? No. No. No. Mm? No. It's parked in the um, surf club's car park. Yes. Our friends dropped us off the day after. It was. That's right. Yes. That's... Yes it was. No. No. My car doesn't have door lock. Um, electronic entry. No. That's right. Like comment...
