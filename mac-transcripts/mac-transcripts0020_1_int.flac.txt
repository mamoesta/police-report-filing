 Okay, so basically I slept in yesterday. I got up about 9 a.m. I had toast for breakfast, peanut butter on it and just a glass of water. I then took my two dogs for a walk and we walked for probably about 40 minutes or so. It was pretty hot, so we walked them early. Then I came back and I did some washing, put some washing on, hung the washing out. I did a bit of study for an exam that I've got coming up. I had lunch, which was leftover Thai from the night before, green curry for lunch. In the afternoon, I watched a bit of television. Before, I then went at about 4 o'clock to just play muck around basketball with some friends. So I did that for a couple of hours and that's then. So I came home about 6.30, 7 o'clock. Then I had dinner, which was like a spaghetti bolognese sort of thing. Basically, I did a little bit more study and then I basically was watching TV at the same time. I just organized stuff for work today because I'd been off for a few days. So I just got my clothes ready and all that sort of stuff. Then basically, I ended up going to bed about 9.30. I read for about an hour and then I went to sleep. It would have been just after 9, so I got up about 9 and then had breakfast within that sort of half hour. It would have been about 12.30 or so. I was watching a DVD. It was called Weeds, which is just like a comedy drama sort of series, I guess. So I basically just watched a few episodes of that in a row. At night, after dinner, I was watching Masterchef. No, that's the Channel 10 one. The junior one, the kids. I drove. I drove my car. I got a car and a motorbike. I drove my car because it was hot. Yeah, it would have been between 6.30 and 7. Yeah, about 9.30, I went to bed and read. On Saturday, it was a fairly similar routine in the morning. I was in get up, have breakfast, walk the dog. I did some more study because I said I've got a test coming up. I also did some gardening. I got a vegetable patch, which basically needed a whole lot of clearing up. So I did a whole lot of weeding and that sort of thing. Also, I've got two chooks I was cleaning out there, their little hatch area and play area. So I was doing that. Yeah, did some more study. Basically, just kept around the house on Saturday. Didn't do too much. Toast? No, very occasionally. Not much of a cereal person. No. Oh, dogs. Got two dogs. I took them for a walk. Yeah, tried to get them out walking at least once a day. When you got back, ironing? No, I would rarely iron. So I know I wouldn't iron. Iron as little as possible. What did you do? So when I got back, I would have been doing some study, something like that. Had lunch. Did you do washing? Yeah, I did do washing actually. So yeah, I did. And then you? Yeah, yeah, a fair bit of study over the weekend. And then for lunch? Yeah, well, I had Thai, which was left over from the night before Thai. Yeah, it was Thai. Did you get that home? No, my partner picked it up from work. Did you go? No, no, no. She picked it up on the way home from work. And then? No, no, I was watching a show called Weeds. Yeah, I haven't really watched that other show. And then you went? Basketball. Yeah, so yeah. Softball would have been alright, but it was basketball. Okay, so do you like playing? Oh, I had played it before. It was pretty fun. I'll pretty much play anything. So for dinner you had? No, definitely not steak. Vegetarian. So it was like a version of a spag bol with beans and stuff instead of mint. And then you just walked? Yeah, yep, it was. And you went to bed? It was a bit earlier. It was about 9.30 I think when I went to bed initially, yeah. And then I read for a while. So when you went? Well, I took my car. So yeah. So where did you park? Just on the street near the court. Do you remember? No, I don't remember a Smith Street. I might have, but. We've got some info that a murder's involved in the incident. Okay, yesterday? Yeah, no, as far as I'm aware, my bike was at home. Yeah, so I did. Do you loan your bike? No, no. Does anyone else? No, no, not at all. So 4pm you were riding your motorbike? No, definitely not. And? I drove my car. When was the last time you had your motorbike? Well, I did see it yesterday. It was in the morning. Yeah. Any damage? No, it seemed fine. It was just where it usually is. Yeah. And when you got home, did you notice the motorbike? Yeah, I didn't actually see my motorbike. It's like when I got back because it's parked in a garage sort of thing. So I'd seen it in the morning, but then my car's actually parked out on the street. So when I'd been sort of out in the backyard washing or whatever, I'd see my bike in the morning, but then I didn't sort of go back out to it in the night. So I didn't see it when I got back. And you didn't notice? No, I didn't see it this morning. No, same thing. Just got straight to my car, so I didn't see it. I assume it's still there. Okay, so on Saturday, when was the last time you rode your motorbike? It would have been really early Thursday. I ride my motorbike to work sometimes. So I finished work on Thursday morning about 6.30am and rode it home and put it in the garage. No. No. I'm just going to ask you some questions. What is your name? No comment. No comment. No comment.
