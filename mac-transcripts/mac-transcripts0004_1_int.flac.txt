 Um, what did I do yesterday? I got up, went to work, worked on the chem targeting course stuff and... Oh, okay. Okay. Um, yeah, so I just basically did my work, met some people for lunch and then went home. Oh, actually no, went to the gym, went home, went out for dinner and yeah, then eventually got to bed around midnight. Five o'clock I had some Weepix coffee, motorbike. Just before six o'clock. It is, it is very early. Yeah, no, just informal meetings more than anything. But yeah, just discussing what's happening for the rest of the year. A Celebrity Slim Shake. Actually no, it was a Celebrity Slim Soup. So yes, that's what I had for lunch. Yeah, yeah, just a few friends. No, probably about five, I reckon, about five. There was other people there, but they weren't part of our party. No, just worked mostly on the computer for the afternoon. At four o'clock? No, no, went to the gym. And then an hour and then, no, then I rode my motorbike home. Motorbike. Yeah. And then? I went up to the pub and met a friend. I had Portuguese chicken burger. Yes, it was, was. I felt very justified that I could eat the burger. So what did you do after? I walked home and went to bed. Yeah, probably. I was in bed by, well, I fell asleep probably around just after 12. So you said before? Weepix. No, normally I'll have a shake. Yeah. Or an apple. I felt like something different. Yes, I knew I was having soup for lunch, so I was. And then? No, we work over the road. Yeah. And then? Yeah, yeah. And they had, what did they have? Sandwiches and leftovers. Leftovers? Oh. They brought in leftovers. And so that was only you? No, a couple of work blokes. Oh. Yeah, yep, five. Yeah, about five. Was it? No. And then? No, I walked to the gym. You walked? And then rode my bike home. Yes, sometimes. When I need to get into the city. Yeah. Either that or a train. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's too, there's too many cars. Yeah, it's annoying. You sit in traffic the whole time. I'd rather just sit on a train or a bus. Yeah, so. Okay. No, chicken burger. Yeah. Portuguese chicken burger. Portuguese chicken burger. Yeah, it was good. It had like avocado and garlic aioli and stuff on it. Yeah, it's a bit fancy. Twelve o'clock.
