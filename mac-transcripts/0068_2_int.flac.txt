 Okay well to start off I got out of bed late. I didn't turn my alarm on the night before. I normally get up at about 10 past four in the morning but I woke up and it was 4.33am. Did the same this morning actually, got up late again. Okay got out of bed yesterday, up showered, dressed, drove up to the station to catch the Hapas 5 train. I then, but on the way through I called in and bought the newspaper which is fairly unusual because normally the newsagent's shut when I go through there at about 10 to 5 but yesterday morning at about a quarter past five it was open so I went to the newsagent, spoke to Dave for a couple of minutes, caught the train, sat in my normal sort of area where I do, read the paper for um, when I say read the paper, read the first five or six pages at the front, first five or six pages at the back and then went to the crosswords. Started off, did the the jumble word, the little telecross word, worked my way up in difficulty. Hey did I get them all out? No I did not, got most of them out but did that. So rocked into work at about oh I don't know 25 to 7. Soldie and Johnny Cameron said oh nice of you to come into work, yeah if you're late. I said yeah well I'll just change my shift because it's flexible rostering. Um did that, had my breakfast, normal routine, read the uh read the paper through the um internet services on Google. That took a little while. Boss came in, spoke to the boss, um then what else do we do? Now it gets difficult how to do some police work. So we uh yeah I went through my telephone message, I've got a telephone answering machine on my desk upstairs because I'm normally never there and my emails, went through all those, addressed those inquiries as required, um worked on a couple of returns for a couple of different commands and then at about, oh I've asked 10, called 11, I got a phone call from Burwood, the lamb at Burwood and um thought I can fix this problem, I'll come down and see you. So went down to Burwood command and I have no problem about that but we went down there and uh sorted out their issues that they had, had a bit of a discussion, had a uh, after we finished the work side of it, had a guided tour of the new Burwood police station that's virtually the newest one in the state, going from a grotty old, grotty old building to now a three-story plus basement car park. It was allowed the luxury of parking in the basement car park, um did that, got back to work, I'd now one o'clock had lunch, did uh three fairly heavy reports that have to be sent off to fairly high ranking officials in the system, um did the graphs, made sure that um the information in both collated together so it all balanced out and then uh went home, caught the normal train home, up past 3 train, started to read my book, fell asleep like I normally do, got home to an empty house except for the dog, so I'd heard the dog for a little while, wife came home, we then went out, we're tied up with a dog club and last night was the last hands-on training session for the club, so while my wife was walking out on the paddock with the dog I was doing some uh administrative stuff with the club and just helping out generally around the office area, uh we had a snappy uh like supper that um we attended and that was quite well appreciated by the members of the club that didn't have to donate to it and then um went home, watched a bit of telly, went to bed and that was yesterday, I was in bed by 10. At the supper there was a mixture of, well actually we bought some little Christmas date tart things, they were nice, had one of them, um had a couple of lollies, couple of twisty things, um that was about it really, we just made sure that the 40 or 50 people that were at the training session had adequate supplies, um the food was well appreciated because most of it was gone, we tied it up at the end, I wallow in myself, we tied it up at the end of the process and um it was gone, went home and then had two, actually had a meat pie and sauce for two that I got out, no supper wasn't dinner, no, we don't eat before we go to dog training, we eat when we come home, it was just a little supper snacky type thing for the club just as a bit of reward, it was the last general training session, we've got our next um next Thursday night's training, it's actually a dinner and the club presentation night at a sort of pub I think somewhere from memory, so um and not everyone will go to that but um no it's just a like a thank you thing for the end of the year, we just put on a few nibblies and a little supper, soft drinks were available for those that wanted and tea and coffee, no no no, had a meat pie, had a one was a yellow, so it's a sergeant's meat pie with fountain tomato sauce, no it was pretty bloody ordinary, quite ordinary, um yesterday for lunch I actually had a leftover salad and it also had in it a product, it's a new rice salad that my wife's got her hands on, so I had two mixtures of salad and I put some tuna that was in olive oil, mixed it all through, it was quite nice and I washed it down with a lovely can of diet pepper, riveting stuff, uh breakfast cereal was special k on soy milk, now soy milk don't fool faces, soy milk is actually quite palatable after, now look I've only had to use it for the last two years because of dietary issues that I've grown into, I'll tell you the first couple of days I could have died, but after that it just just becomes second habit, I only have it in coffee, if I drink tea I only drink black tea or when I say black tea I drink a peppermint tea, so I don't have milk in a peppermint tea, so that's and that's the only tea I drink and I only have three or four of them a week if I'm lucky and I'd have maybe three or four cups of coffee, I normally only drink tea and coffee at work, it's pretty rare at home to be quite honest, no no no no no, 4am I was still snoring my little head off, I should have got up at about 10 past four but I distinctly remember when I woke up it was 4.33am and I thought I'm late, who cares, got up, had a shower, same thing, just caught the later train, same routine, just the later train, started half an hour late, finished half an hour late, as I said flexible rostering, yeah about 20 past three, I was on the 3.30 train home, no I drive, well in the family at home we currently have three, I physically own one, my wife has a car and my son has a car, but yeah, no I actually have two registered in my name, my wife's car is actually registered in my name too, you could technically say I own two, no the five, that's 5.35, no 5.32, 5.32 it comes in and it was spot on time yesterday, I sat in carriage one, I sat at the rear end, which is the main walk-in area and I, bit of a creature of habit I suppose, I sit in the same seat nine out of ten times I catch a train, because I'm lucky where I catch the train, it's 90% empty, well where I catch it where I live because I'm so far away, not where we are, when we get about halfway through our journey when it gets back into metro area, yeah it's like a sardine can, people stand up for the last 40, 35, 40 minutes of the trip into town, no I started at about, oh between 6.35 and 6.40, no no no I actually went to Burwood, joining suburb, you're close, it's a joining suburb, it's actually a suburb where I used to go to school, so it brings back memories, I used to live just around the corner from where I actually had to go to, so the old nostalgic drive, yeah the old house is still there, no I got back from that about 1pm, yesterday I always try and sit in carriage too, because it's closest to the stairs when I get off the train at the other end, and just trying to think where did I sit yesterday, sat downstairs, yeah sat downstairs, and yeah I think I sat next to a lady from memory, she was into a book, yeah it was a lady because she was reading a book, and then I started to do my crossword, I do a crossword normally coming in if I'm not reading my book and going home, and then come about 20 minutes into the trip the old eyes said it's time to shut them, so I shut them for about 15 minutes, still woke up and still managed to get off the train at the normal spot, negative, know a lot of people that have, but I have not done it, it was like a sad, I'm lucky like I tend to try me one of the first half a dozen to get on, nine out of ten times, eight out of ten times you'll get a seat, and you might have to stand up until maybe Blacktown, sometimes a little bit further, it just depends, and it depends on whether there's school, kids on the train, school excursions, like the train going home the other day was packed with a high school group of I'd say year 11, year 12 kids, and they occupied 90% of the carriage, so muggins here stood up until they got off, so did everyone else, yeah we still have kids get on that, but the kids that get on here at Parramatta are fairly respectful and actually give their seats up to adults, so there are some nice ones, but most of them couldn't give a hoot, they don't care how loud they talk, what they talk about, or how polite or impolite they talk. On the train going home, well you couldn't technically say rage, you could say giggly voices, just girls talking girl talk, but no just girls being giggly, no argumentative type voices, no tempered voices, no, no, no, it's pretty, look it's pretty mundane our train, it's a nine out of ten times, it's yeah you'd say 80% of the carriage is the same people day in day out, they're about 4.30, quarter to five, nah just buggerised around in the yard, didn't walk a last night, and the reason I didn't walk her last night, as I said we had dog training, so I'm not going to walk her before that and expend energy, just did a little bit of basic training with her, and even when my wife came home she did a little bit more, I tend to train the dog without food, whereas my wife trains her with food, so no exercise, just I took her for a walk the day before, no, no, with my wife, club for about, I don't know, two hours I suppose, no, pie and sauce, sergeant's pie and fountain sauce, Nah went to bed about 10, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, definitely no comment, as old as my tongue, and a bit older than my teeth, but no comment, that's personal, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, definitely no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, yeahвой, no comment No comment, no comment, no comment.
