 Okay, yesterday morning, Sunday. Got up, had breakfast. I went to... went and had coffee with the family at a nearby cafe. Came home, worked in the yard for a couple of hours and then got on the train, went to work and was in the office most of the day. Did some paperwork, worked on some case folders until I went home about 11 o'clock. And then I went to bed and that was about my day. Yes, I drove home last night. Um, company car, yeah. I got home about quarter to twelve. Yeah, and then went to bed. No, I didn't. Probably quarter past twelve. I got up about eight o'clock. My wife was and the kids were.
