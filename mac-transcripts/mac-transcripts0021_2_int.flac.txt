 I woke up at 25 past 4, got up, had a shower, got my lunch, then went to work. What did I do at work? It was a hard day. I can't remember what I did yesterday. I went to Parramatta for EFIMS training. We left the SPC about 7.30 and then had the EFIMS training. It lasted about a quarter past 12. Then I went back to the SPC, had some lunch and then I did a statement and then I went to Balmain for a job and I returned to SPC at 4. I left work about 5 past 4. I went home, waited for my partner to get home. We were sitting out in the backyard talking. I know prior to that I cleaned up the backyard and the laundry where one of our dogs put mud everywhere because of the storm. And then I went out the back and then my partner came home, we were just talking. She made dinner, we watched a bit of TV and then we found out that we have a house that we're buying. Far more interest than the other day. I went to bed about 10 past 9. No, I had it at work. I had cereal. No, the boss doesn't mind generally. Oh, she's there now but our old boss wasn't there when we were having breakfast. I was lazy, I called a taxi. That way I could sleep in. Well, no, my alarm went off at 4.25 and I snoozed for generally till quarter to five. But yesterday I snoozed to about five o'clock. It takes me 15 minutes to get to work when I catch a training walk. Yeah, no, it was $16. Rare occasion that I could catch a taxi. 6am. I had breakfast, read the Sydney Morning Herald online and then read my memos and that's about it. Yep. What did you have for lunch when you took lunch from home? A chicken salad. I think it was about 10 past 1. Yeah, about main like that. Yeah. Bus and walk. I go home about 10 to 5. Yeah, because I missed my normal bus. Mexican, where you have the mince and that on the chips. Nachos, homemade nachos. Yeah. Oh, we got the phone call. I got the phone call saying that we have put, they've accepted our offer for the house and then I went to bed straight after. 4.25, my alarm went off and I got up about five. No, I was lazy. I caught a taxi to work. No, 16. Yeah. No, I had cereal. Generally, yes. No, very rarely. Sydney Morning Herald online. Yeah, because the Daily Telegraph plays up online. So I just read the Sydney Morning Herald. Yep. Yep. E-fims. Yep. No, no, I had a chicken salad. No, my partner made that. Sometimes. When I, at the moment I've been really good and taking lunch, but that's only sort of been a new development the last couple of months. Yeah. Yeah. No, I went to Balmain in Leichhardt's area for a job. No, I wish that would be overtime. Finished about four. Caught a bus. No, no. Drops me off further down and it's like a five minute walk home from there. No, the backyard and the laundry. No. Nachos. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, about quarter past nine. About three times. I think about maybe February. Started like this year. Sometimes I flag them out the front or otherwise I walk further up to the main road. I walked up to the main road outside the SPC. I had to get changed. Yep. Yep. Yeah, I went in up the stairs, up the elevator and then when I got changed. No, I didn't. I paid for the taxi. No, but I paid for the taxi. The taxi will probably have the camera in line so they'll be able to get, download the footage and it'll show me giving the money over. Well, that's wrong, because I paid for the taxi. Yeah, it's fine. Okay. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment.
