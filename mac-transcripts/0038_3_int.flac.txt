 Well, I had the day off again because I'm part-time. That's why I get so much work when I come in on the days. But what did now I got up. I had the little one had to go. We're up at 630. The little one had a doctor at 8 o'clock. So I took him and the five-year-old and we were in there for an hour and a half and then took them both to their respective schools. And then I went home, collected some stuff and off I went to the shops because I had to get my watch repaired. I hadn't had a watch for a week. Off I went to the shops to get the watch fixed, pick up a few Christmas presents. And the shops are going berserk now. I was only in there for two hours. And you had people queuing up for your car park. It's not normally like that so soon. And then I left there. I had a quick swim because I didn't know if I'd have to come into work this weekend. So that's my exercise for the week. And then came home, quick turnaround, went up to get the little one from school. And she insisted on having a friend. And I was just exhausted. So we had the friend and then John rang and said he'd be home in an hour. He's been away all week. So that was exciting. So I drove the friend home and then started getting the dinner ready. So it'd all be ready. And it was a bit of a yucky dinner to be honest. I often do that. I just take a bag of nuts and eat as I go. It was Mongolian lamb, but he was a bit sneaky. He'd put in so much of the syrup and then weighed it. And he was trying to be helpful, but it ended up just being a lot of black goo with just tiny bits of meat. And he charges so much. Must have been a dollar every little strip of meat. It would have been about not much. And so when you cook it, it just looked like thick black, you know, that it's supposed to not be that heavy. And it was the kids couldn't eat it. Was this too yuck? No, no, no. No, you buy it pre-made and just fry it up. From the butcher. Yeah, it ended up being a bit yucky. It was very disappointing. So yeah, so we did that. And then we look forward to watching Beauty and the Geek the final. And that was good. Yeah, and that was that's what we did. Not till a bit later. So I put the kids to bed 930 930 1010 1030 maybe. Okay. Remember I still floating around doing things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Luke Luke Luke. Yeah. Yeah, he's got no lips. Yeah. Yeah, it was good. Yeah, really nice. Really nice show. Yeah. Yeah, I was at work. Yeah. Yeah, I drive Street parking. Yeah, go Street. Yeah, great parking to the curve. There would have been yeah, the one in front of me. Oh, oh two names. Yeah. Yeah. And my and my son's learning to drive on it. No 630. Yeah, an hour and a half. Yeah. Yeah, 930 10. No shops. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, crowded. Oh, no, not in the shops, but that was filling up. Yeah, it was for me easy and then people queuing up to get as I left people coming from all directions to take the park. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. No swimming one dog. Yeah. No was wet. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Julie will come in. I just leave carry on. Yes, I did. But the school so near you only get about halfway between your house in the school and because everyone's because of the wet so it was a little point. But yeah, we drove. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What Fred one friend? No, about half past four five o'clock. Yeah, it was revolting. No, no one did must have been very hungry. Was shocking. No, he charges a lot. He's up the road. Nice fellow. Very good looking butcher. But it's just annoying because he doesn't get many customers. So he kind of doubles the price on everything. So it's $22 and it was just black. Oh, no, it wasn't good. No geek. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I should know the channel and I don't and I've watched it all season. I don't know what channel more like 1030. I think yeah, no comment. No comment. No comment.
