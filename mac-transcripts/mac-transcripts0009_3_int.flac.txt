Cereal. Just Sultana brand. Yep, had coffee. Well, around 7.30 when I had the breakfast. Yeah, I drove. 12.30 I had chicken and salad. About an hour. At 4 o'clock I went home and got showered and got ready to go out. About 8 o'clock. Yep, I don't remember the name of it. I caught the bus into the city. I got home about 3 o'clock in the morning. No, it didn't. It kept going. A taxi. Saturday I... I can't remember. Saturday... I did a lot on Saturday. I cleaned the house and then I went for dinner at Bondi. I got there for 7.30. Umm... well, I had duck for entree and mixed seafood for entree and then I had a seafood platter with pad thai. Oh, about 10 o'clock. No, went to Glebe. Had dinner drinks. One, three. I drove. Yes. No. No. Five years old. Hmm... no. No. Well, I might have one. No, I didn't. No. That's not me. It's not my car. No. No. No. Myself and a passenger. One passenger. Actually, I was. Hmm... yep. No. I travelled west. I was a bit later too. It wasn't 10.30 now. I was about 11. Yep. Hmm... no. No. No. I did see them but not on Harris Street. Oh, I can't remember now. Possibly. I doubt it. I don't know that street. No. Possibly. I do. No. No, they didn't. No one flagged me down. Positive. No, that's lies. Because they are. It wasn't me. Rapid... Rapid who? Well, they're lying. It's wrong. Well, you need to show me that because it wasn't my car. Up the road. This morning. No, there's no damage. Definitely. No. No. Well, you don't walk around your vehicle every day, do you, to check if there's damage? Well, I don't. Definitely not. No, there could be. Yeah, fair enough. Can I take it home today? Okay.
