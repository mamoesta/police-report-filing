 I got up at 3.30am because my daughter was crying. I went in there and asked what she wanted. She said, Mommy, Mommy. I said, Mommy is asleep, what do you want? Mommy, Mommy. I said, ok, see you later. When you want to tell me what you want. I am cruel. I gave it another couple of minutes. Went back in. You going to tell me what you want now? She gets really bad. She gets bitten by ants or mozzies. She swells up really bad. She wanted some itchy butt cream. I put that on and went to bed. That was 3.30am. I managed to get back to sleep. I got up at 7.30am. I had some breakfast. Watched the news. Mrs and Rose got up at 8.30am. I tended to the garden. It stopped raining. My tomato plants had grown heaps. I tied them off. On the stakes. What else did I do? It was Rose's kindergarten Christmas party. We went up there. Had lunch. Santa came. We had to quickly dash home. She had to get changed. She had to have some photos taken. For her dance. In her costume. Why they didn't do it on the night of the dance concert. I don't know. I got dropped back at home. Mrs went with Rose. To her mother in laws. Sorry. To my mother in laws. To her mums. I read the paper. I washed my push bike. I degreased the chain. It was disgusting. I greased it all back up. I oiled it all back up. I polished it. Took good care of it. They came back by that time. It was late afternoon. I took the washing off the line. I played around with Rose. Had dinner. Watched telly. Gave her a bath. Washed her hair. Went to bed. I got all my gear ready for work. Went to bed. I think I ended up. I got all my stuff ready early. It was 10 o'clock. I went to bed. I taped on SBS2. I taped Bear Grylls. Return to the Legion. It was a really good show. I saw it years and years ago. Before he did his current stuff. Going in the bush. It was a really good show. I think when I watched it. I missed the first couple of episodes. Last night was the first episode. I was happy. Bear Grylls. Man vs Wild. I think that might be a nickname. I think so. I can't remember what his real name is. He is mad. He is like an ex SAS. He has done all these. He is a Pom. He has climbed Mount Everest. Done all these things. This show is just about. There are 10 people. 10 Pom. From different walks of life. They go. I don't know what country they are in. They go to a desert. They have all these ex. French Foreign Legion. Training them. What they have to do. Breaking them down. What they do in the French Foreign Legion. Doing a history thing. They talk about what happened. Quite interesting. At the same time. That is why I taped it. I can take it or leave it. It is getting silly. I don't know. I think it is one of those. I was one of these dumb suckers. That is 6 years of my life. I was so disappointed. Anything that is one of those. There are big secrets. To be revealed. I am not interested. There was that other show. The 1300. I think that peed it out. There were a few of them. I never saw the end of that. I watched a few episodes. I went and. Ant bites. The previous day. It has happened twice now. At my Mum and Dad's place. There are ants walking along the pavement. She stands there. And screams while they climb up her legs. On her legs. It is also mozzies. Mozzies were the first. She gets a mozzie bite. The whole calf. The whole calf will be red. And hot. For a week. Take her to a mozzie breeding place. And throw her in. There you go. It will build up some immunity. 7.30. Porridge. Porridge and coffee. No milk. Long life skim milk. I don't like it. No. No. Channel 7. Channel 9. Tomatoes. It went to seed. I think that is a winter vegetable. I don't know much about gardening. We did have broccoli. It didn't look like stuff you get in shops. It did at the start. It was small. If I let it go. It went out. It started flowering. I ate the flowers. I thought they were not bad. The broccoli head. The bulb. That turns into a flower. If it keeps growing. It turns into a flower. You eat it when it is compressed. 1.30. You were supposed to stop. You were supposed to stay. Otherwise they would charge you. They would charge you. If you could drop her off and go. They would charge you. Indie food. Sorry. Dancing. That would be too complicated. It is called Kinder dance. Kinder dance. They do ballet. The other half. They do tap dance. They are four. She is three. You can't watch them. You have to stay there. They have holes. Drilled. You can have a peek. If you want to have a watch. I went there once. A few months ago. I am watching her. During a dancing lesson. She wasn't doing anything. She is just laying on the ground. With another girl. Having a great time. I was assured. That was unusual. It wasn't her normal teacher. When she has a normal dance teacher. She does dance. It is not that expensive. She does dance. She had a concert. She did a few school fights. I went home. They went over. Not that time. I go other times. I don't have to go. She is only five minutes down the road. It is not a big deal. It is not like she was going for dinner. She was just going to say hello. Push pot. Carbon fibre. Washing off the line. Chicken schnitzel. It was not made. It was just bought. It was alright. Sweet potato. It was like a chip. It was like a chip. It was cooked in the oven. We had veggies. I can't remember. Silver beet. It was the only thing. It was a member of the family. It was not rhubarb. Silver beet you eat the leaves. They look the same. Sweet potato. Fresh. Slice it up. It was crispy. The other way around. It only went for an hour. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment.
