 I got up at 4 o'clock yesterday morning and I had a shower, had breakfast, got on my bike and went to work. We were working out at Windsor yesterday. Yes, so we went to work and I was only at work until midday which was pretty good. The boss let us go early and I headed back home and went to bed. I slept from about half past two until five o'clock when I got up, made dinner, washed up and went back to bed. And that was the whole day. I had wheat bix and cornflakes and sultanas as I always do. Very boring. Got to work at 6 o'clock. Zero, 600 hours. Yes, I had meetings. We were demonstrating stuff for other people, members of the public. I did, yes. I didn't get home until 11 o'clock the night before. I only went to bed at four. Five hours sleep, I was a bit zonked. Homemade pizza and pita bread. Pita bread, P-I-T-A, little bread pocket things. Yes. Good at sleeping, yes. I was in bed by eight o'clock, quarter past eight. The day before, that was Saturday, I took my son to wheelchair sports in the morning and then went to a barbecue in the afternoon with a bunch of people who ride motorbikes with me. Yes, dumb thing to do. Four. Four o'clock, yep. Six. Had a shower. I said shower. I rode my bike to work. I usually do, yes. Well, sometimes I drive, if it's raining I drive. Went to Windsor, yes. North Sydney's the wrong way. I didn't, no. I said Windsor. I worked half a shift really, because it was supposed to be a rest day, supposed to be a day off. But we had to go to work so the boss was paying overtime for it. Yeah, or toil, yeah. No, I didn't check emails because I didn't have computer access yesterday. Just a case of doing the work, demonstrating to the members of the public the stuff we do. No, I went to bed. As soon as I got home just about, had a bite to eat, then hit bed. Sandwich. Ham and cheese and tomato. No, no. I pay someone else to do that. For dinner we had pita bread and pizza. Homemade pizza. I went to bed. Cleaned up, went to bed. I'm good at that. Sleeping, yes. I was in bed by about half past, quarter past eight or so, I was in bed last night. The day before I went to a barbecue. After going to sports with my son. Eleven o'clock.
