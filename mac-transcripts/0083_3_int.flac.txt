 Yep, I got up at 4.30am, had a shower, got dressed, had wheat bakes for breakfast, then I drove into work, left home at about 10 past 5, parked my car up the road, walked into work, started at 6. I was just in the office, did the voice comparison thing at 8 o'clock, then went back, did my work, had lunch at about 1, then finished work at 4. Went and got changed, walked back to my car, drove home, got home, went on the internet for a little bit, then watched a bit of TV, then I made spaghetti bolognese for dinner and watched a bit more TV and went to bed at about 10 o'clock. Yep, no I didn't. Sometimes, but I didn't yesterday. No. No. Not really, no. I left, alright. Yeah. About 35 minutes to where I parked, then about 10 minutes to walk in. Just on the street. I believe so, yes. I think I was behind a car. No. The one I was driving, yep, one. No. No. Oh yeah. No. Don't remember, no. No. No. Yep. They're lying, they probably just didn't see me. No I didn't.

Only if I'm planning to drink after work. Yep. But not really to work, but no. Nah, I don't really like Twitter. Yeah, I went on Facebook. I checked my hotmail, but I didn't really send any. Spaghetti bolognese. Yep. Yeah, it's pretty easy. Nah, I cooked it. The mince, onions, pasta sauce, and the water. It was a little spiral ones. Yeah. I think I watched an episode of South Park and something else. Can't even remember. Yeah, I watched a little bit of it. I think it was seven. Nah, nah, nah, nah, never watched that.
