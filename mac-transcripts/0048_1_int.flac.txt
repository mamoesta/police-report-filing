 Okay, got up, I had my usual breakfast which is coffee and porridge. I took my wife to work, drove her to work at Janali, then I drove back home with my three-year-old, got her dressed, did her hair, then I took her to gymnastics in the morning, about 10 o'clock she does gymnastics, for about an hour, hour and 15, then Franklin's had a sale on for milk, so I went and got a whole heap of milk there, then went back home, had some lunch, which I remember what it was, salmon and tomato sandwiches, so I got lunch for me and my daughter, then after that, time for her to have a sleep, so she had a sleep for, she probably had a sleep for about an hour, hour and a half, and I caught up on a bit of TV that I'd taped, then when she got up, what did we do, I did a little bit of gardening because I got a veggie patch and stuff, then we went out, because I was looking at pumps, sump pumps, so I went to a pump shop, by the time we, then went and got petrol, got an ice block, which I don't normally treat her to an ice block, but she got an ice block, so she was, she was ecstatic, and then picked up my wife, then went home, cooked dinner, had dinner with my daughter, my wife went to Zumba, then she came back, so sat down, had a chat while she had dinner, put my daughter to bed, watched TV, fell asleep on the lounge, cleaned my teeth and went to bed, well I did, I fell asleep on the lounge, but then I um woke up and I watched, there was a show that I forgot to tape, so I watched the last 20 minutes of that, so I think it was about 10 30. It was uh Kill It, Use, Kill It, Cut It, Use It, it's the second in a series, the first series was Kill It, Cook It, Eat It, so it's basically telling people about, trying to tell people where, what animals are used for and stuff, so last night they were doing pigs, and they had a, it was quite interesting, they had a girl there, had a, she actually had a pig's valve in her heart, so they did an autopsy on a pig and said, well there you go, that's the valve, and took the heart out and stuff, and then they showed how you make gelatin from pig skin, and said that's, and then went around to people in shopping centers and said you know those bath, little bath gel things, they go well that's got, it's gelatin on the outside, and I guess all the tablets that you take, that's all gelatin, so again we're basically eating pigs sort of skin or whatever, or the fatty sort of, yeah it's pretty interesting. Kill It, Cut It, Use It, it's on ABC2 at 9.30 on a Wednesday night, uh Kill It, Cut, uh Kill It, Kill It, Cook It, Eat It, and they actually stayed on the farm and they killed, well they didn't have, they watched various animals get slaughtered, they took care of them and looked how they, uh how they cared for on a farm, and the farm was, it's a British show, the farm was a um, it was sort of the top end type farm that you know, they give massages to the animals type, type thing, but and then they showed, they did the comparison what you find like in battery chickens compared to how they keep their chickens, and, and battery sort of, well pigs that when they're um, the sows, when they're, after they give birth, when they're, the little cage that they're in, whereas their ones are all, you know, free range stuff. So I joined the difference there, they had some vegetarians there as well, trying to see whether they'd be convinced, they had some people there that just eat fast food all the time. They're mainly young people, because I guess the premise is that people are so far removed from where meat comes from, where food comes from nowadays, so it was basically, yeah, so they, they, what did they start with? I think they started with a cow was the first thing, each week they'd kill something else, so, but it was interesting, I don't know whether they go into the same extent over here, because they had, because of the mad cow disease over there, they actually check and examine all various organs and the brain and stuff like that, and if there's anything that they're not happy with, the whole carcass gets tossed, they don't, they can't, can't, because they have to stamp it that it's fit for consumption, so, and the vegetarians, the two vegetarians were main vegetarians, and the, I think the girl that does all the budgets, you know, buys all that frozen, because in England they've got big freezer shops where everything's just, you know, frozen, frozen everything, even frozen, what was there, there was frozen Yorkshire puddings, like Yorkshire puddings are easy to make, like you can get everything frozen there, so she was sort of, they're trying to convince it a bit, buy smaller, eat smaller amounts of meat, but better quality stuff, no, no, yesterday morning I would have been up at seven, seven o'clock, which is a sleep in for me, coffee and porridge, no, I make, I make my porridge with skim milk, long life skim milk, that's how I was able, that's why I can go when there's a sale on, I can go and buy heaps, because it's long life skim milk, yeah, yes, um, the round trip, or just one way, round trip is, she starts work at about, left at eight, and I was probably back at about 8.30, 8.40, yeah, daughter to gymnastics, that was Franklin, yeah, Engadine's great, you got, you got, you got every single supermarket you can get there, there's an RTA there, which is unheard of in, it's an RTA there, you've got a Medicare there, so you can just walk up and get all these, I don't know if it's because it's cop land there as well, you go up, there's police everywhere, we get looked after, milk and what else, I've got a couple other little things, but mainly the milk, oh milk and we're out of butter, oh margarine, salmon, yeah, occasionally, I'm not, I prefer salmon to tuna, from about 12.30 to 1.30, looked after the veggie patch, yeah, well, we've only got one car, so it's our car, it's, it's registered in my wife's name, yes, so really, I don't have a car, yes, we went straight from gymnastics, yeah, no, but pulling out, I do, just a lady, didn't know how to drive very well, doesn't know how to reverse out of a parking spot, then doesn't know how to, because it's a pay thing, but it's free for the first couple hours, doesn't know how to put, how to park close enough, she had to actually get out of the car, to put her, her, the, the little slip in, so the boom gate had opened, and I was behind her in the car, in my car, in my wife's car, it's a little bit away, but in the same aisle type thing, so yeah, so I had to wait for her to drive out of a car spot, which about three goes to maneuver around the pole, about the poles, and then she's driving very slowly, and then, then she couldn't park close enough to the, the scanning, the scanner machine to operate the boom gate, no, because she was too far away, she tried numerous times, and then realized that she'll have to get out of the car, but I wasn't in a rush, so I just thought it was funny, no, yeah, no, no, no, no, I thought it was funny, yeah, no, no, I had all the time in the world, maybe if I was in a rush, maybe, but I wasn't in a rush, no, definitely not, no, no, no, because I know how to park close enough, that I can get to the, to the scanner, so no, I don't need to get out of my car, no, good, well, you can have, obviously, you haven't looked at it then, before you're interviewing me, oh, I'd say, no, I'd like to see that footage then, okay, okay, no comment, no comment, no comment, no, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, No comment.
