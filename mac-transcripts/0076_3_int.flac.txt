 got up out of bed, I stayed in bed for a little while after I woke up and then when I got up I went to the bathroom and then I went into the kitchen and probably drank a cup of hot water with lemon in it and then started preparing a shopping list and then looked at cookbooks to look at recipes and different things to work out what ingredients we were going to need at the shops. Then my wife and I went out onto the back veranda and did a meditation for 20 minutes and then came back inside, continued on with the shopping list and tidied up the kitchen and had a cup of tea and a couple of pieces of toast and then I put a load of washing on in that process so while that went through we just kept tidying up the kitchen and looking at the shopping list and chatting and listening to music and when the washing finished, went and hung that on the line but bought yesterday's washing in and then hung the other washing on the line and then we'd finalized the shopping list and went and got changed out of my bed attire and we went to the shops we went to Paddy's Market first and drove around, took a little while to find a parking spot finally got one, went into Paddy's Market but went upstairs the market first to the ATM and took some money out and then we went downstairs and forgot the shopping list in the car so I had to recreate and remember and walked around and bought all the things and we only missed one thing off the list which was quite good. So once we'd finished our shopping we'd walk back to the car, put that in the boot and we went to the shopping center to the supermarket and did our grocery shopping and then we went, there's another fruit market downstairs where we bought some things that we'd prefer to buy there rather than Paddy's. Took that home unpacked the stuff that needed to go straight into the fridge and packed that away. While I was doing that, my wife made us some breakfast so it was a lot of fruit, she cut up some pineapple and blueberries and strawberries and passion fruit and had that on some cornflakes with yogurt and sat and ate that and read the newspapers or just flicked through the newspaper and that took us through till about 12.30 or thereabouts and then I cleaned up the laundry, we have a cat and her box is in the laundry and of late she's missing the box so I had to strip the laundry out and bleach the floor and bleach her toilet box and once that was all done, before I did that though I made a marinade mix for some chicken because I was going out to a barbecue so I just made a marinade mix of soy sauce and garlic and ginger and oil and put the chicken in that, popped that in the fridge so it would marinate prior to going to the barbecue and then I jumped in the shower and got dressed for the barbecue, grabbed my chicken and left, my wife stayed at home and kept doing a bit of stuff around the house and I went to my friend's house, I was about 40 minutes late or after the time party or barbecue started when I got there, there were five other people there so we sat around and chatted and then the barbecue started it was a Weber barbecue so that took a while to heat up so we just sat around and chatted and talked about the local area and each other and caught up as friends do then we ate some of the, then we cooked the barbecue and kept chatting and ate the food and kept chatting and about six o'clock I went home when I got home my wife was in the shower so I just said hello to her and then started getting dinner ready and stuff for our lunches for the week so cooked some rice and we had some fish cake mix all ready to go so I made the fish cakes and cooked those and before I did that, pretty much as soon as I got home I went and did another meditation and then went out into the kitchen and did all that other stuff and then we sat down and ate dinner about quarter past eight and we just had some music on and we were chatting and when dinner finished I ironed some shirts and we just kept chatting and kept music on and about 10 o'clock we went to bed and I read for a little while and then went to sleep about 11.30 I woke up about six o'clock then went back to sleep and then woke up about half past seven it was about 10 o'clock I think maybe a little bit later we got home a bit after 12, 20 past 12 maybe no we had some breakfast and had something to eat and then I did the cat then I did the laundry so we had something to eat and then I was reading the newspapers and then I got up and did some so that was about 20 to 2 that I did the cat box, left at 2.40 or 2.30 or thereabouts, I got 20 minutes later at the most 3 o'clock at the latest. It took a little bit longer yesterday because we stopped at a shop on the way so normally it would be anything from 5 to 10 minutes so it was about 20 minutes because we stopped at the shop and then because we stopped at the shop I had to take a different way to get to the Paddy's Market Two, yes one is jointly registered but I think they only record one name on the papers black one, a black one and a white one. Yeah the white one is hers and the black one is mine yes yes correct no you need to be more specific there are lots of incidents yes rather not say when you say the car collided with the cyclist or the cyclist collided with the car no the cyclist collided with me, hit me I was stopped at traffic lights and he came up and hit me from behind ran into the back of me I think he was taking a photograph at the time he fell to the ground after he hit me yes but I didn't hit him no he hit me I was stopped so the information that you've got is incorrect yes yes yes yes wow that's amazing, it's incredible how they can doctor footage now days You know that for a fact wow I suppose its a matter of interpretation My vehicle at the smash repair shop no comment...no comment no comment no comment...no comment...no comment no comment...no comment...no comment...no comment! no comment...no comment...no comment...no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment No comment.
