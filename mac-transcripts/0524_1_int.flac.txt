 Um, well, my son played cricket on Saturday morning. Not really. No, no, no. It's been school holidays. I haven't really done much at all. Oh, not recently. A big day. No. All right. Saturday morning. We do. I'll get up and I walk the dog, take the dog for a walk. I just take him. It's a two kilometer track around my house. So, um, that takes us about 25 minutes. I don't walk real fast. He doesn't walk real fast cause he's old. So, um, uh, and then took my son to Amaru school for cricket. We spent three hours there watching him play cricket, keeping my other son entertained because he was getting bored. Nope. Nope. I don't like it. My son likes it. That's why we go, but I don't really, I'm not really fast on. Yeah. So 2020 is only 12. It's 12. Um, so yeah, it's only a 2020 match. They have 20, 20 round, 20 overs. Yeah. He prefers batting. Yeah. And he got a few hits. He didn't, um, he, he got a few hits and had a couple of runs. So that's about all we can hope for. He's not, I mean, he's not, you know, he's not fantastic at it, but he likes playing it. So I don't know, five or six. Yeah. They had to turn to bowling and he got, once got someone out. I'm sorry. Excited. He bowled it and one of his team caught them. Yeah. No, no, no. Well, the other team, which was Western Creek, they had, uh, two girls who play ACT rep cricket. Yeah. So they weren't, um, I think it was, they're probably hard up to, well, probably weren't going to win anyway, so, but that's okay. Three hours out playing cricket, which is what he likes doing. So, no, same age group. So he's under 13. Yeah. But they play, yeah, play rep cricket, apparently, which was what we were told. So yeah, they did everything. Yeah. Pretty much. No, well, I guess we didn't know. And, uh, yeah, I don't know that you can, and they're allowed to play, aren't they? Cricket. We, um, went home, had some lunch. Uh, and then my son has guitar lesson, just sandwiches. Devon. Yeah. My kids like Devon sandwiches, Devon and tomato sauce. Yes. He has a guitar lesson every Sunday. Yep. Sitting, reading my book while he has his lesson. It's only half an hour. Went to, where did we go after that? Put fuel in the car. Went to Magnet Mart, had a look at Magnet Mart. No, I didn't buy anything at Magnet Mart. Just had a look and then home. No, no. Just watched, um, watched a movie. Was there footy on? No, no, we didn't watch the footy. No. No. What movie did you watch? Um, The Rocker. Yeah. I like it. The kids like it too. Kind of funny. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Sunday, nothing. Had nothing on Sunday. So we just hung around at home. No, I probably did a bit of gardening, but that's about it. Yeah. The kids are really into cutting down the trees, so I'll let them loose with some secateurs, yeah. Chopping down some, trimming back some trees. Um, yeah. Mowing. Yep. Oh, just the mower. Yeah. Well, my, my husband helps with that. So that's the mower and that sort of thing. Watched the footy. That was the night the footy was on. How'd you find it? Oh, crap. Buddy Quade Cooper. Oh, I'm guessing you're not a fan. No. I was, while he was playing with the Reds, but he seems to have, I don't know, lost the ball or, no, no. But he, you know, he played really well and he was a good player. No, but he, you know, he played really well and then he's coming to the wall of his squad and there's, I don't know, pressure of international football seems to have affected him, so, yeah, they did all right. What about the ref? I thought he was okay. He was all right. Got a funny name for a South African, but that's all right. Yeah. Yeah. Is it? Yeah. Sounds French to me. Oh, are they? Okay. Fair enough. Okay. Couple of questions. Um, so Saturday, you said all you did in the morning was that. Yep. 25 minutes. Oh, it's slow. Cause the dog's slow. He likes to stop and sniff and, you know, do dog things. So that's okay. I'm not really doing it for exercises just for him. Take him out. Well, I'm trying to get him fit. That's why I take him out every day. Okay. And then you said your son, the cricket. No. Yes. Well, I guess it doesn't take as long. It's only three hours, so it's not my whole day gone, which is good. And you said your son, Gordon. No, no. It's got a couple of runs. Yeah. But not, he doesn't, he wasn't the top scoring batsman. Yeah. Well, he didn't. Well, it was caught off his ball. What was it? Yeah. It was a pretty good catch. Yeah. He was pretty excited. They lotted. No. Well, I don't know that it's cheating. The kids are allowed to play. No. No, no. I think one of them actually bowled him out. Okay. And then you just drew. Yep. Devon. Yeah. No. Well, it doesn't come out of a can. You get it from the deli at the supermarket. Yeah. No. Guitar. 30 minutes. Trimmed him back. Yep. They've got secateurs. And we've got a saw as well. Little hand saw. No, no. You know, that's quite what you said. No. He kicked it out on the full at the start of the game. No. Runs. No. No. They should have got him off. No. No. Oh, God. Dropped the ball. Fell over. He's had better games. That wasn't one of his best games. They might have scored a try. I don't know whether they would have won. I think the All Bucks were going to win from the start. Yeah. Well, he didn't have a real good game. I don't know. I think they did all right. No, I don't think so. I think it was pretty fair. Yeah. They made some silly mistakes. Yes. I agree. And now you're happy,
