 it doesn't matter yeah lovely hassling me about the tequila shots hahaha entertainment yeah exactly yeah that's all we need from you that's fine thanks yeah exactly i did definitely alright from start to finish i spent friday night preparing food for a dinner party i was hosting on the saturday night so just did a lot of marinating of meat and uh... well i did uh... pork ribs uh... chicken breast and diced beef and made kebabs out of them and uh... yeah it was about eight kilos of meat all up so it was a lot of meat uh... there was about ten of us i suppose it was a fair bit of meat yeah but there was a couple of boys there who eat a lot so at least probably closer to one half i'd say hahaha yeah but the ribs had a lot of bone on them so i suppose there's a lot of weight in that so yeah so yeah i got that underway and then just um chilled out with my puppy for the rest of friday night then on the saturday morning just um... uh... made breakfast for my housemate because it was his birthday and um he's allergic to eggs so i cooked him eggless pancakes no they always have eggs in them because it's the rising agent in them rising and binding agent yeah it's very difficult to cook pancakes without egg otherwise it's just like cooked glue because it would be just like flour and milk really yeah probably out of a shaken shake and bake mix no i cooked homemade pancakes from scratch without eggs which was challenging but they were damn good yeah i was pretty proud of them and then yeah i cooked him a birthday cake as well uh... and then yeah started cooking the rest of the stuff for the dinner party that night and then just took my puppy to the dog park so he could run around and cause a ruckus as they do yep he's a ten month old black labrador so he's um... a bundle of energy yeah he's not too bad on the noise he doesn't bark very often but he's very excitable so yeah he's about thirty kilos worth of energy just yep being a doofus yeah he'll get up to about thirty five kilos so yeah then um... that afternoon went to my mates house because we were hosting it at my friends house so went to my friends house and we started just having a couple of mojitos and getting the barbecue ready to cook all the meat on and then spent the night there eating and drinking which was great and then stayed there that night and then the next morning got up and cleaned up her house for her and then made a breakfast which was not not low in fat felt a little bit worse for wear afterwards needed a nap so spent the rest of the afternoon sleeping pretty much and yeah it was a good Sunday yep and then last night what did I do last night I went to a friend's house for dinner and watched the rugby yeah it was good very entertaining yep yep so yeah had a good night um I didn't actually I was very impartial um I was I was sort of going for France before the game started and then while I was watching it I was actually very impartial wasn't really going for anyone I was just enjoying the game yeah yeah that's true yeah wasn't really swayed one way or the other wasn't really fast but yeah then yeah just had an early night last night that's exactly right I need to catch up you're about my age there's no such thing as catching up well should be so last night did you spend the night? yep there was some red meat there was some beef yeah but then there was pork and chicken no just well there was chicken and beef separate yep the chicken breast was just on its own and then the beef was on kebabs so I skewered the beef yes yeah did take quite a while but it was it was very fun I like cooking so yeah I like taking my time with it I know well actually it took a few trips but when I was on my way out from the shop so I was definitely loaded up with shopping bags yeah quite heavy yeah that's exactly right yep do some bicep curls yep and then you said you went to puppy puppy? yeah that's right that afternoon the dog park no no I just spent about an hour there yep yeah just run around and just be a nuisance yeah it's good no I run around with him and then I do some training with him as well so yeah just yeah intermittently I'll call him to come to me and sit at my feet and then we'll do some like you know shake hands drop on the ground like put food down and tell him to leave it until I tell him to eat it and yeah oh yeah all the time he's brilliant yeah he never eats it without me saying so like if I drop something on the ground and don't even tell him to leave it he'll leave it anyway automatically yep yep he'll look at me until I tell him he can eat it yeah absolutely I know well trained yeah and then next morning it was your um yeah that's right you had quite a lot of difficulty was it? oh it wasn't too bad um but it was very involved like instead of the normal three ingredients that you put in pancakes there was about 10 ingredients so it was a lot more involved than cooking pancakes with egg in them but they turned out very well no I didn't he was awake yep so what was it? it was chocolate yeah yep it was Mississippi mud cake no no there's still half left of the cake but yeah I had one slice do you reckon these cakes were? yeah they well they tasted pretty much exactly the same as pancakes with egg in them which is hard to achieve so they're yeah they're really good they were nice and fluffy okay and you said you took your puppy to the dog park yep yep he wasn't out of energy no not at all I don't think he will ever run out of energy yep you said the rest of the night you were yep um it was Canadian themed well it didn't really look like much everyone sort of came in plaid or like flannel um but exactly um but yeah it was just more about the food oh just a flannel shirt yep I just got back from Canada so I acquired a couple of plaid shirts while I was over there yep you said you ate quite a bit of mosquito killer yep oh yeah about that about that actually ate quite a bit yep and you said you were worse for wet well I didn't have too much to drink but it doesn't take very much for me to get tipsy so I had one tequila shot and one shot one shot and a few mojitos and a couple glasses of wine sure we slept the rest of the day and had a greasy breakfast with waffles no no that's just a normal Sunday standard standard yeah yep at my friend's place at my friend's place yep no I yeah I did clean up the next day for her you did yep there was a little bit of chicken left over really yeah there was about three chicken breasts left over that was about it well we did get through all the beef kebabs and all the ribs but yeah there was about three chicken breasts left over so we got through about seven and a half kilos of meat no no he doesn't eat human food he only gets dog food yep and yeah saved the leftovers and yep they're for me oh he would if I let him but I don't let him yep I don't give marinated meat to my dog when I can eat it no way he gets dog food and then you said yes that's right oh no it was alright yeah no it was alright he would do spa of course he would yeah he probably got down the mat yeah I did actually watch after the game finished I pretty much just turned the TV off didn't watch anymore after that no no I didn't I saw the French players having a bit of a cry so I was like yeah that's enough for me turned it off yep alright good thanks okay same as last time just act as a past witness yep no drama last Friday night a lot of meat no comment pork ribs no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no commentary comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment comment
