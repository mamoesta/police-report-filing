 Okay, I got up, got ready for work, made my way to work, got here nice and early, had breakfast, had started the day. Then I thought, I think I'll need a coffee. Got to that time when I really needed a coffee. Did some more work, went for my walk down to the river, but they've actually closed off the river down here. So yeah, then got home, cooked a lovely pasta dish, went to a gym and yeah, then went to bed quite early actually last night. I think about eight o'clock. A bit of zoo, the zoo, and there was some other animal show on, but I can't remember what it was. It was after the zoo. So no, they had baby cubs and I can't remember, could have been baby animals or something like that, but yeah, I like animals. And what time did you go? I went about six o'clock, half an hour. You made? Yes, I did. Spaghetti with roasted vegetable sauce. Yes, meat as well. Yes, minced meat. And yeah, it was very nice. My daughter, youngest, had lots of plate, which was good. So about four thirty, straight away. So when you said you walked the river, was that- Yeah, I usually go for a walk at lunchtime, just a bit of exercise. And what time did you go? I think I had lunch a bit after twelve yesterday. And what did you have? Oh, I had a roll with, a wholemeal roll with cheese, ham and lettuce. It's very nice, nice and healthy. And what did you have? I had the sports cereal by Uncle Toby's. So muesli, cranberries, strawberries, peaches and sultanas. Yeah. And what did you have yesterday? Got to work about quarter to seven. I got up about, no, not five thirty, about quarter to five. Yes. I got myself up, I did my weighing, had my shower, got myself ready, which takes a long time. And then I rock up my two little ones and got them ready for school. Yes, it is. It is. So you said that, oh, you said that yesterday you wanted to walk down the river. Yes. Just a bit down from where the ferry or the river comes. They were doing some work on the bridge, so they've sort of closed it off. And usually I walk down, cross the bridge and walk down one side and then walk up the other side and come back to work. But yeah, they were doing some work on the bridge, so I could only walk one side and then walk up the street the other way back to work. So I couldn't do my full river walk yesterday, unfortunately. So when you said the bridge on the other side of the river, where all the floods? Yes, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. So you walk along double back. Yes. Yeah. Yes. The one going down. I think so. Yeah, I think it is actually. I'll have to pay attention next time I go for my walk and see what it is. Yeah. So I'm not sure. I really don't look at street names. So you said that you got up yesterday at about five. Yes. So that's only about an hour before you go to work. Yes. Yeah. Usually the alarm starts at four o'clock, but I love that snooze button that I keep on hitting. OK, so you got up at five? No, no, no. Sorry. Four forty five. Sorry, did I say five forty five? So no, four forty five. Yeah. So you hit snooze button. Yes. Then I think I better get up and get myself ready. So you got into work at about? Quarter to seven. What's your? Usually, yeah, flex time starts at seven o'clock. So so that gives me that 15 minutes of having breakfast before I actually have to start my work. OK, and for breakfast you had wheat bits? Just the sports cereal. Do you eat wheat bits? Sometimes when I'm at home, I used to, but now I've gone on to these other muesli cereals. I have them instead of the wheat bits. OK, do you ever have? I'm not a Vegemite fan, but my husband's determined to make me one. But at the moment I'm not a Vegemite fan. So have you ever had Promont? No, no, I've never tried that. It's supposed to be a look. Oh, is it? Oh, maybe I should give it a go. Some people don't like the tartar. Yes, yes. Promont's good. Oh, OK. Well, I have to have a look and give it a go one time. Yeah. And have you? No, no. That's another one. Oh, OK. Yeah. No, I'm more of a peanut butter person. OK, what about the jam? Oh, I love jam. I love strawberry jam, plum jam, raspberry jam, apricot jam. I love them all. Have you ever had mango? No. You can get the raw one. Yeah. Oh, wow. A lot of time, so. Oh, OK. Beautiful. Yeah, no, I love mangoes. I could look. I can eat them. You usually get five jam. Oh, yes. One of. Crafts. Yeah. Sometimes jam. Oh, OK. I'll have to have a look next time I go in one. So you had lunch? Yeah, at 12. Yeah, a bit after 12. Yeah. And you had a lettuce sandwich? Ham, lettuce and cheese sandwich. Yeah. Do you ever? Oh, yeah. I eat chicken. I had chicken on Sunday for lunch. Beautiful lemon garlic barbecued chicken. It was beautiful. And you had, you got home from work? 4.30. 4.30. 4.30, got home and yeah, got the girls to do their homework and I got started on dinner. How do you get to work? I drive to Penrith Station and then catch a train in. OK, so what time train? I caught the express at about ten past six and yeah. Oh, sorry. I thought you were talking about my way home. On to work. Into work. Sorry. Yeah. Into work about ten past six. Yep. Yeah. On the way home, I get probably I leave here probably about three o'clock. So I'll get the 3.27 mountain train. OK. So do you remember which? Oh, no. Just going to any. I'll just go into any carriage. I'm not. Yeah. You're not going to heaven? No, no. OK, so the carriage. No, I actually sat in the centre. Yeah. Yeah. I normally don't go up stairs or down stairs. I just prefer to sit in that centre area. And yeah. Have there been any school kids? Yeah, they usually get on at Restmead. And they allowed a bunch. But anyway, I guess we all were when we were at school. And yeah. So yesterday on your way home, did you hear any loud? No, actually, I had my headphones on listening to my music yesterday. So I really don't hear anything. No, no. Do you hear the conduct station? Sometimes. But yesterday I was a bit drowsy on the train, so I actually had to stand up and move near the doors. So I wouldn't miss my stop because I kept on falling asleep on the train. I didn't hear anyone. No, no, no, no, no. You're not aware. No, no, didn't see anything like that. OK, so you said? Uh, 4.30. At 4.30. Yeah. And you started making some dinner anyway? Yes, spaghetti. Just normal thin noodle spaghettis. Yeah. It wasn't? No, no. I've yet to try them, but one day I will just for something different. OK, so then you went and had a half hour with your private trainer? Well, sort of. Jess at the gym. She's sort of my private trainer, but she's a great motivator. She gets you moving. And you went to bed at 4.30? I just, yeah, just had enough by yesterday. I guess the extra weight work was enough for me yesterday afternoon. I'll just ask you a question. OK. What is your family name? No comment. What is your date of birth? No comment.
