 Okay, I got up when one of my kids started crying. I gave them a shower and then when one kid gets up the other kid wants to get up. So I got them up, gave them a shower as well, had a coffee, got the kids breakfast, dressed and it was raining I think so we just spent the morning watching DVDs. Then we went up to Winston Hills shops and then I drove up and I had a look at a new church I wanted to go to and one of my kids vomited in the car park so we went back home again. What did we do after that? I think then after we just spent a lot of time watching TV and mucking around under the awning in the backyard, got dinner ready, spent a bit of time on the internet and then that was my day probably around seven o'clock. I don't recall having breakfast to be honest but I had that coffee. Oftentimes I don't have breakfast but when I do Wheat Picks is my normal breakfast. Yep, yep, yep. I think we watched Ben 10 a couple of times over because they don't care about watching the same thing over and over when they like it. I don't recall what else we watched. My wife came home maybe around three o'clock so maybe a bit after three o'clock. About 15 minutes. Yep, yeah. I think I went home first. Yeah, probably around five o'clock. An hour. Yep, yeah, yep, yep, yep. Sounds about right. Yeah, yep, yep. 5.30? Yes I did. I had half a punnet of mussels and a wrap with ham. Yes, bit after three. Yeah, yeah, yep. Bit of TV, got the kids ready, hang around the house in the evening. Bit before seven probably. So we had pasta and I had a piece of leftover KFC. Yep, in the evening. I think my wife was watching a crappy medical show so it was on but I wasn't paying attention and then the internet. 8.30, 9 o'clock? No I got up way before 9am. Probably around seven. No I didn't have breakfast yesterday. I had coffee. Yep, sometimes. Sometimes I drink tea when I feel like I'm having too much caffeine with the coffee. Definitely didn't have a cup of tea all day yesterday. No, because it was raining in the morning so no. It was raining in the morning yesterday. Probably eased off during the day but no I didn't mow the backyard. Watched DVDs. I might have watched Foxtel when they finished watching their DVDs but Ben 10 is the big winner at the moment. Yeah? Yes. Yep, right. I don't think we watched DVDs when they went home. I can't remember what we did when we got home. Yeah, we watched quite a bit of TV during the day. I can't remember. It was a fairly non-eventful day yesterday. The day before was a very eventful day. The kids hang out with their cousins and ran themselves right. Ran themselves ragged. So yesterday was just the wind down day. Yeah. Eight. Maybe a bit earlier than eight. Definitely earlier than eight. We had ravioli. That ravioli out of the packet that only takes five minutes to make. And a piece of leftover KFC. I've never seen an episode of Underbelly. Nah. Muscles. Yeah. Half the punnet of oysters comes in a little tub. I don't eat half the tub. Yeah, sounds about right. Kids and me. Yeah. No, she stayed at home. Yep. I don't drive on Smith Street to go to Winston Hills. I most definitely don't drive on any Smith Street to go to Winston Hills. From my house to Winston Hills is only a few streets. They're all long and there's none of them called Smith. Not in particular. No. No, not in particular. Two. I think so. Yeah, I did it. Yeah. Yep. Yes, you got me. Which one? It's parked out the front with a cyclist embedded in it. Yep. Take down the guy a cup of coffee because he's there. He's still embedded in it and he's been saying that he wants something to eat. Yep.
