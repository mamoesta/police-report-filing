 Yeah I got up, yesterday was Tuesday, I got up at about quarter past six, had a shower, got dressed, went downstairs, had some breakfast and then got in the car, drove to the station, caught a train and it was a 7.30 train and I got to work at it just after 8.30 and came into work and got started on work. Keep going? Yeah, um, oh yeah it was a few issues you know, there was a few phone calls, a few problems, um, I just told a few people to go away, not interested, I wasn't helping them anymore, told them to get over themselves and uh whether they were offended or not I didn't really care and uh one guy tried to shout at me and I just hung up on him and uh told him to get a life. Yeah, so that was probably the high point of the day actually, him, yeah got me all fired up, yeah it was quite interesting, um, haven't heard from him since you know, he's a bit of a troublemaker, he's got quite a reputation so you know I'm not concerned by him, you know he's a senior officer but I should throw his weight around and people just ignore him, um, just a troublemaker, I don't know why he's still in the organisation, um, yeah I've made some inquiries and and uh yeah I believe they're looking into him um because of um some um involvement he's had in corruption and uh taking backhanders but um I'm not sure whether that can be uh substantiated or corroborated, uh, I'd like, I'd like to see him go down and you know really as far as I'm concerned the guy ends up, he deserves to go to prison, um, but um I'm probably not the only one that thinks that, yeah so we'll just see what happens and if they want to come and talk to me about it I'll tell them what I think and and why the guy is um shouldn't be in the organisation any longer. No friend of mine, don't like him at all, no one likes him, don't even, I don't know if he got any friends in the building, um, people see him and walk away, you know, and leave lobbies and lunch rooms and eats on his own, um, people just avoid him, he goes down to the uh cafe and outside and people just sort of like open up around him and no one talks to him and uh it doesn't seem to bother him, yeah, so it's sort of quite peculiar in a way, uh, that that situation should get to that point but you know if that's the way he wants to conduct his life that's up to him, um, maybe he needs some counselling or some psychological assessment, uh, but really, you know, we're all, we're all responsible for our own actions and and how we conduct ourselves and clearly that's his issues, he's got to deal with it. Yeah, look, I think they're looking at him but I don't think anything's been clarified at this stage, I'm not concerned by that. Let's hear say, any, if no one can prove it? No, I didn't actually, uh, about four, what time, oh about 4.15 it came in, no, I, no, the station, yeah, no, about about seven, yeah, I did, uh, can't remember, um, uh, hold on, yeah, spaghetti, spaghetti bolognese, that's right, no, with leftovers from the other night, yeah, yeah, I watched a little bit of, um, can't remember what it was, uh, best of Australia's Got Talent, which was quite, quite amusing, yeah, it was quite entertaining, I thought, it was good, nothing, nothing of interest, I probably did but I just can't remember, so it was obviously forgettable, about 10, yeah, yeah, because I was on a train at 7.30, cereal, wheat bix, no, not in summer, yeah, I do sometimes, yep, rarely, rarely, no, I just don't have time, normally, no, well, my wife doesn't like eggs, so there's a, there's a disincentive to, to do it, but the kids like eggs, so, you know, sometimes it's a case of if my wife has to go out somewhere, we'll make eggs, sometimes that happens, no, I caught the train into work, no, the train left at 7.30 and I got to work at about 8.30, no, I got up at 6.15 and left at 7.15, 8.30, work, yeah, there was a few issues, but nothing of any great consequence, other than this fellow I was telling you about earlier, who's quite a, got a reputation in the, in the organization, right, right, uh, yeah, I probably did threaten him, doesn't bother me, I'll take his head off, uh, probably a figure of speech more than anything I would actually do, I wouldn't actually kill him, but, you know, when someone says I'm going to take your head off, it's a case of, um, well, I'm really angry with you, so get out of my face, or I'm going to explode, you know, type thing, so it's just another way of saying that, I'm going to take, I'll take your head off, can I actually physically take his head off, no, doesn't concern me in this situation, because I think it's justified, they should have got rid of this guy, I'm just reacting to a situation, yeah, tough wall, yeah, I did actually, yeah, yeah, I thought I'd stalk him for a while, just to see how he reacted, oh, let him, let him, let him fly his complaint, see how it goes, hmm, yeah, between 4 and 4.15, no, I think, no, he's wrong there, no, it was after we, from when I left at 4, but, you know, nothing that he says can be believed anyway, so he's another lie, hmm, yes, I know, I might have slipped through without swiping, because sometimes the gate is open from the previous person, I might have just walked out, yeah, um, 7, no, 7, hmm, uh, I think I got in the car and I went around, sat outside his house, yeah, I took some photos, mates and, oh, just the surrounds, anyone in the street, because I just want to keep an eye on him, yeah, um, I had spaghetti, spaghetti, not ravioli, no, I watched what, uh, no, we watched, um, Australia's Got Talent, best of, very good, about 10, hmm, I like questions, they're quite good, sorry, white, oh, sorry, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment
