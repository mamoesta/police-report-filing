 Yesterday what day was yesterday? Yesterday was what's it today would be Tuesday because it's trivia night. So yesterday would be a Monday Monday I on Monday mornings I have to actually get to work quite early now when I say early early for me is not necessarily Early for the rest of society you see I set my alarm at 7 45 in the morning so that I can listen to 15 Minutes of ABC News and I get out of bed at 8 o'clock I get out of bed at 8 o'clock because you know Mondays I have to shave to come to work and I can't usually can't be bothered ironing my clothes on Sunday night So I do like a small spot of ironing on Monday morning Breakfast cereal can't start without having a shower and without breakfast in the day my day just does not begin until those two conditions have been met I then get to work and The boss normally insists on having a Monday morning meeting which is always Fabulously enlightening you know a meeting that should take about 20 minutes generally takes about two hours And if I'm lucky the first cup of coffee lasts 10 minutes and of course I can't get up to get a second second cup Of coffee so you know I struggle through the rest of the meeting to get through to what I need to do Lunch is usually about midday we go Probably next door just to grab you know a sandwich or a pasta or something yesterday happened to be a chicken Caesar salad You know you find that because the building next door has a food outlet most people in this building are too lazy to walk any further To go and get some real sustenance for lunch. We keep on going through to the end of the day I ended up finishing at about four o'clock because I needed to go home and mow the lawn and yes yesterday was an incredibly hot Day, but because I'm actually moving house soon the mow the lawn actually needed to be mowed So I had to do that which was quite unpleasantly uncomfortable But it got done and then I actually took the lawnmower over to my mother's house so that well you know she can Then mow her lawn, and I don't have to store it in my garage, which is full of crap Of course driving to my mother's house, so I forgot the keys so of course I had to sit outside and wait for her to come Home which can be any time because she's turned into a bit of a gym junkie lately go figure And that was pretty much it got to see her got to come home, and that was the sum total of yesterday dinner Yes, I did there was a there was a piece of fish there was about maybe 20 solid-sized chips, and there was a bit of salad which was Lettuce tomatoes bit of dressing capsicum, so I try to be vaguely healthy never eat enough fish in my diet So you know always trying to do a little more fish when possible so that was a pleasant way to pass the evening No, I tend to not watch television I tend to be out in the road out and about with the Pleasures of Foxtel recording these days I tend to not watch any live TV at all and when I do watch live TV it annoys Me because you can't fast-forward the commercials which are now so used to Fast-forwarding so I'm gonna have to pass on the question of TV shows well that was spent at my mother's house So I went to a wedding and earlier in the week as part of the two funerals a wedding and a birth That's occurred in the last little while and so I showed my mother some of the videos that I took while I was at the Wedding and I showed her a lot of the photographs that were had it was a family wedding Up on the Gold Coast so she got a chance to sort of have a look at sort of whatever I was wearing at the wedding And asked me oh what about this person what about this person what about this person so? There was a fair bit of that along coming She always likes to kind of have a look at what's doing lately so yeah, we've always spent the evening doing that She's got herself a new bar. She's gonna. She's got a galaxy tablet similar to an iPad But a Samsung version before they were deemed illegal to be sold in Australia So it's possibly a rare product, and it's really funny because she's actually for someone who's not a computer person learning how to use Portable technologies, so I'm forever just showing her how to use Skype and Facebook and whatnot so we went through a bit more general instruction So it's good on her for actually getting out there and giving it go I know there's a lot of parents out there that the new technology is just beyond them So they don't even try anymore, so there was a bit of that as well And I think she's sort of getting there slowly it was probably at 2300 hours when we left it's maybe a good sort of 20 minutes half hour to get home And it's awesome because home is North Paramount so for me peak hour traffic is crossing to the other side of Victoria Road Sometimes I even have to wait for two sets of lights to change Unbelievable you know so I love because people's three people's three biggest complaints about Sydney is a combination of traffic parking and public Transport pick two out of three and that's what people's biggest gripes are and you know when you live one suburb away And you can walk to work, and it's like well parking is an issue traffic's not really an issue So hence why I can afford to sleep in till 8 in the morning and people like you go to you know What time you go to bed you get a bit about midnight 1 a.m.. So yeah, I go to bed at 1 a.m. I get 7 hours sleep like the next person. I'm out of bed at 8. I'm at work by 845 like it's you know It's just normal to me, but people are like wow how can you do that? But you know you make lifestyle choices one of them that I choose not to live far away from my workplace at 1130 it was Probably went to bed about somewhere 1230 to 1 o'clock probably closer to 1 you know by the time you kind of take the washing Off the line and fold them up, and then you know jump onto your Facebook and maybe check out Twitter See what's happening in the world No So you read Twitter instead of reading the daily paper because if anything big happens in the world Twitter will tell me about it sort Of before I read it in a newspaper So it's a you know it's sort of a way to keep in touch with the world sort of at just before I go To bed and then when I wake up in the morning as well the alarm goes off you know I'm listening to the news in The background and actually tells me the real news I just check the Twitter and the Facebook status updates that tells me what's happening instead of in sort of friends of mine that I have around the world because I've traveled a fair bit find out what's been happening with there And yeah, that's how that's how we start the day about 745. I do have an alarm clock It's called the gentlemen that are building the house about two doors up from me There's one guy at about 650 every morning who starts the day with a hammer and literally it's just him and a hammer and just occasionally He'll just go tap tap tap and he'll move on to something else tap tap tap and the for about maybe 20 minutes before anyone else makes any noise is just one man and a hammer 650 every morning you can set your clock to it. I'm sure it's illegal I'm sure he's not supposed to start till 7, but hell what are you gonna do so anyway? I kind of you know Try and sort of ignore that till the alarm actually goes off at 745 And I can start off my daily routine by listening to the news and checking what's happening online And no it would be ABC News Radio ABC local has 15 minutes of news so I can find out what's happening sort of here and around the world and just find out Basically if there's anything that's gonna affect my world at work because occasionally things happen in the state of New South Wales that might actually Affect my time in the workplace, so it's possibly good to just maybe mentally prepare myself If I bet if I'm about to walk into some bad juju well no I don't shave every morning for me shaving is extremely optional Because I don't have face-to-face contact with the public very often so unless I know I've got some meetings planned or I'm meeting other People I don't necessarily shave every morning because for me not shaving that saves like 15 minutes in the morning And it's just you know 15 minutes on my work time or 15 minutes that I can be doing something else in the world and No breakfast is always three week picks sugar And I've taken to trying soy milk just because someone said if you actually there's a there's a soy milky product And I've actually tried it and actually it's actually not that bad you know and I just thought you know what I can't actually Make an informed decision without trying these things so I thought the best way to do it was actually buy a liter and try it And I must actually say that you know other than the fact that I consume you know two and three liters of these things only Come in one liter tetra packs, which is possibly my biggest complaint Um yeah, I don't really you know soy milk doesn't particularly bother me more or the other compared to sort of regular or light milk I can you know you don't get to be my size without enjoying a bit of food along the way correct well anyone who knows me will know that it's Absolutely, not the case would never happen not unless there was a really really good reason such as I'm flying from the Gold Coast To fly to Sydney and had to be in a car at the first available opportunity I had to wake up 430 that day, but having worked 12-hour shifts previously I've done the whole 6 a.m.. To 6 p.m.. Shift work, and then 6 p.m.. To 6 a.m.. Shift work, so it was great I enjoyed it loved it at the time But that's possibly younger man's game is waking up early That's not for me the other thing is also we have a whole lot of internal cameras in our facility So we can actually check on the clock exactly what time I came to work and anyone who knows me They know that I didn't come to work at 730. We do have swipe cards to enter the building I do have a current swipe card I use the ones assigned to me every day usually to come in through the roller doors With a vehicle to start with then you'll need to use it again to get into the lifts from the car park into the building So yeah, it basically lives on me because well I can't go near without it and when I lose it when I leave it at home And I forget forget to bring it into work. That's when it becomes just a real pain absolutely That again. It's not possible And we have all kinds of evidentiary footage that can prove to the contrary That I'm not an early to work kind of person And that's not possible since I managed to get into the building that means I had my swipe card on me at all times So yeah, I would therefore be challenging the security company to come up with any evidence to the contrary Okay, first of all I would start with the basic premise that most people are idiots So if they tell you that something is absolutely foolproof I would start off by saying you know what that basic assumption there is incorrect So when they say that they are sure that they did their system checks I would counter that by saying computers as well as Human input creates errors all the time so therefore that's not possible If there is camera footage of me, I doubt that there would be two good-looking roosters like myself in the one space so Therefore I would also Challenge that footage to be produced in order to say you know what that person is nowhere near as good-looking as I am so therefore That could not possibly have been me besides look at the shoes that person was wearing no chance lunch was about 12 o'clock and Lunch was from next door at a place. We call George's although It's not it's actually called cafe Yota But we call it George's because George is the one who comes and deals with us all the time and lunch happens to be a Fabulous little chicken Caesar salad which I know has really bad dressing on top But I asked for extra dressing anyway because well it always gets stuck to the lid so you only end up ever eating half the dressing Anyway, so therefore I felt justified that I could ask for more No I couldn't think of anything worse than having an avocado and chicken and pasta mixed up in a salad that just makes no sense at All people are weird. I would have finished work up possibly around 16 45 hours, but you know let's split the difference and say close enough to five o'clock that is correct well Let's not say five o'clock on the dot But circa five o'clock that would have been about the hour that I left the building yesterday in theory or in practice in theory Yes, absolutely you do in practice when you've been around as long enough as I have you tend to know all the security guards And they're quite happy to let you in and out at any time because they recognize you you just give a friendly smile wave And away you go so actually no I didn't need to use my swipe card to leave the building Again, I would have to say that the maybe the cameras haven't been calibrated for daylight saving perhaps that might explain an hour Differential there a lot of people don't know how to reset the clocks there No again, it just wouldn't be any of ways in my footage would identify me as having left the building at 1600 hours so again I would be asking serious questions of the security company providing you with your information because Well in short they are wrong You know what that's a really good question it might have been a little bit earlier than five o'clock But it was now any for I'm packing up my box But I don't have a new house to move into yet That's part of the things I could be doing if I wasn't at work and recording some Voice thing for a university person that's come into our building he was requesting volunteers to do some kind of a setup Which I'm sure will identify my voice in some database in the future so that they'll be able to nail me to any place I might do something in the future that is correct absolutely But I also unpack the car from the lawn mow that I took to her place and a couple of extra boxes of excess things that I probably Didn't need at the moment in the process of moving so I've just left those over there as well comment No commest no comment no comment no comment no comment
