 okay yesterday being monday had to come to work so the alarm went off probably sneezed it a few times and got into work at nine o'clock and then did a um sat down it was a quiet day at work is it working and um it was a nice quiet day so pretty much sat next to a colleague and i we just worked away got everything up to date um because there was hardly any staff or any distractions and noise and then went for lunch went for a walk at lunchtime god isn't that funny i'm trying to recall and um came back had some lunch and then continued working till at least 4 30 and then walked back to my car and drove home no it was about a bit later than 4 30 and then went and um i was that tired i had a 15 minute sleep because i had touch football at 6 30 and i just needed a little tiny kip to keep me going and then drove to touch football played a game got back home probably about 10 to 8 um ended up not that hungry so i just had some cereal for dinner and because i had a fairly big lunch um and then cleaned up the house because i got visitors soon and then went to bed and i was probably trying to still get to sleep by about quarter past 11 or so so that pretty much was consisted of coming to work playing a game of touch football and nothing out of the usual really okay so did you go you went to bed at 11 no i was trying to get to sleep at 11 15 could have been just say after 10 anyway so yeah i know and i was probably hyped up from the touch football too you know running around i got into work at nine so i would have probably gotten up i think i snoozed it and got it i was a bit naughty got out about at eight because it was a monday morning normally i'm at the gym but that day i was just too tired so i slept in and what did you have a chicken salad from up the road yes had cereal at work at my desk so breakfast at my at work and um you said that you finished work about 4 30 i think so but i know i was still driving at i was at my car yeah i was at my car at quarter fast by so i must have left a bit later i think it was quarter to five actually i did leave and then i was at my car at quarter past and then home about quarter to six oh normally doesn't but that's the time it was a bit after five so was it raining yes no it was at night uh when i was putting the rubbish out but no it's sort of i don't remember it sprinkling i didn't have an umbrella so i think it was just gloomy so where do you park your car parking or do you know i walk a fairway so 20 minute walk so just for free parking up near victoria road um and then um when you got home you had a half hour nap just a probably 20 minute 15 to 20 minute i set the alarm okay so what time did you go to football it started at 6 30 so i pretty much left home at about quarter past but pretty much all my clocks are all um different so the one in the car is five minutes fast the ones at home are on time so my mobile is always fast um and how long did you play touch football there it would have been at least till a good hour 7 30 yeah by the time i walked back to my car would have been another 10 minutes and back home about 10 to 8 and did you watch i put um yeah the i was flicking through some shows i think it was the the semi-final of the x factor because um i was going to turn it off and then i watched a little bit of the kyle and jackie o new show which and then it was just getting too late so i turned that off see so it was really i was just on the laptop and i was just that was in the background so just in and out of watching that did you like that kyle kyle and jackie o different they had cs celebrities on there but i only watched sort of a good 15 20 minutes of it so i would have wanted to stay on but it's just too late to that would have probably started at 9 30 or 10 so i just knew i had to get up early so i ditched it okay and that's on channel two i think it was on channel x factor seven i think or it could have been 10 don't know okay so you said that you got up at about 7 a.m in the morning no a bit later but i bet eight okay and you caught the train into work no i drove my car you ever catch never no catch the bus never have you ever caught it yes because my car stopped and i had to get to work your car broke down yeah well it was at the last legs of it and i was waiting for a new car to come in so the bus just takes way too long it was a good hour and a half so never again and the train line's not close at all so i drive okay and when you got into work you had vegemite cereal do you always yes i sometimes do and i also might have hot chocolate and a banana red and naughty things like that but majority i've been trying to get onto cereal and um the um do you have you ever had promine i've tasted it but prefer vegemite i don't think i don't probably might have tried it once but not that i recall that and for lunch you brought in some leftover salad before no i purchased that when i went for a walk to a cafe you purchased anything else no but later on i had another sandwich because i was hungry from the same place no different cafe um so you then went for a jog after no i had to go back and work at my desk and sit there and do my work so no run um did you say earlier that you before you went and got your sammy no no no going out at all so pretty much when i got into work i was there till lunchtime then went for a walk yeah you went for a walk yeah at lunchtime no walked up okay how long did you walk it's only a block away so that's only five minutes put the joggers on and walked a bit quicker okay so sorry you walked up to the takeaway yeah okay so you didn't go for a walk no i had to go up and change an appointment and then while i was there there was a cafe next door okay so um you got back from lunch at about two no i don't know the time i would have got back it would have been at least 12 30 and you left work at about 5 30 no about 4 30 quarter to five a quarter five and then uh don't give about 10 minutes to walk here at least 15 20 but i think i did it all yesterday it took me a bit longer yesterday i think and then you got home um at about um all from touch football about quarter to six and then again back home just before eight ten to eight uh but after work you got home in about that quarter to six and then um after you went and played um softball till 7 30 no touch football went up until 7 30 so straight home after that no other sport and then uh you got home and you had cereal and then you watched um australia's got talent yes okay that's on channel two i believe it was either on seven or ten i think it's on seven um who's winning uh it was in the background so i just remember there was three performances and i think the grand finals tonight so i think there was just the performances last night there was no voting or you had to vote but no one i'm not there was three people in there and kylie minogue was doing a little song with one of them kylie minogue okay so she would yes on stage yeah was that on australia's yep no it is the hang on it is hang on i just can't think right now now it is the x-factor so australia got talent was that on no god you've got me thinking which one it is i think it's the x-factor yeah okay and then um you were watching the kylie show kyle and jackie o which followed after that show so it was on the same channel as whatever that other one was on i think it's on channel seven okay so yesterday you said that you parked your car is that car registered yes um does anyone else know maybe my partner but rarely rarely it's only mainly me and you were the only one yes um and you always park free park yes when you park there is that like you have to reverse park to the parking spot or do you just drive straight straight straight oh it's on the road so it's just street parking so it's not street parking but you just pull up no just pull straight in so it's actually got bays no just it's pretty much like at the front of residential houses so you just pull up like on a normal street and just park on the street okay were there many cars there well it varies but no there's always cars parked there because it's free parking that they all cram in and um you said that you got into work at 9 a.m yes okay um a colleague of yours told me that you got in work 30 a.m no i was at nine so pretty much we have swipy cards to get in and we log on to our flex sheet so um i was in at nine and sitting at the desk so so you said that you have security passed yes check the data on this that actually shows you're 30 it shouldn't be it should be nine o'clock it wasn't pretty much um nine o'clock at you know i don't know if security provided that swipy pass then i suppose we've also got um the logon of the computers or if that can be checked too so all witnesses me being there at nine o'clock um yesterday when you parked your car um do you remember any happening no do you remember actually colliding no because then there was a driveway and um
