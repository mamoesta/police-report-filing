 Okay, I've got up about 4.30. I then drove to the train station where I get the 506 train to Paramatta which gets me into Paramatta, I think around 5.30. I then walk from the train station to PHQ which is only about five minutes walk if that then got changed and went up to the office and basically on shift from 6 until yesterday it was until 5. I had a slightly shorter day and so I spent the day at work just doing the normal office duties that I do. After that I got the train home, back to, back out. Actually went to Bunnings yesterday. After I got off the train, I went to Bunnings, then I went home, played with the kids for a bit, did a few little things around the house. Had to fix a door that was broken. Had dinner, watched a little bit of TV and went to bed. That was pretty much the day. I think I just at work actually had breakfast because it's a bit early when I come to work. I think I got a hot chocolate from the cafe next door and I think I just had a Vegemite sandwich which I made before I came to work. Had lunch I think around 1.30, 1.30 till 2. Just in the cafeteria at work. I had a sandwich, roast pork. I had to get a part for the door that was broken, the screen door. So I had to install that. We had chicken schnitzel and mashed potatoes and carrot and broccoli and cauliflower. That was around probably 6.45. I think I just flicked. There wasn't much on of any interest so I couldn't tell you exactly because I didn't watch anything any length of time, but just sort of flicked to see what was on. 10.30. How long it took to get my daughter to bed? No, no, no. We don't have a TV. No. Straight to sleep. I've been up since 4.30. So that was a big enough day. Last weekend, let's see. I was off last weekend. Saturday actually was my daughter's first birthday. So a lot of running around for that in the morning. Just cleaning up the house. Then had people around, a bit of cooking, did a barbecue and then lots of cleaning up after that. Family over. Some stayed for dinner and some stayed overnight. So entertaining pretty much all Saturday and part of Sunday. Sunday cleaning up. Sunday night. I think the football was on. I saw a tiny bit of that. Not a lot of that. The rugby and there was a rugby union and rugby league as well. But just briefly watched little bits of it. Can't remember if I watched anything else afterwards. Possibly watched something later on in the night. But again, I couldn't remember what at this stage. Too far away. 4.30. Only when I work. Nah, train station. 5.06 train.
