 I woke up at about 6.30 and had a shower and shaved and did my usual bathroom routine. Got dressed. I had a quick breakfast. I had some Weet-Bix. Kissed the family goodbye and went off to work. I got the train at, would have been about 6 past 7. And train from Summerhill to Strathfield. And then I changed at Strathfield and got the next train to Parramatta. Arrived about 20 to 8. And just logged onto the computer and did a few emails and things and set up for training. And at 9 o'clock I had a training session. We had about 8 participants. 5 from the crime scene section and 3 from forensic imaging. And that was our first large training session. It was a bit inconsistent but we survived. We got through. Finished at about 12 o'clock. At 12 I can't remember quite exactly. I think I went to lunch about then. And I had some, I brought my lunch yesterday. So I had some leftover noodles. Noodles and pork and vegetables for lunch. I came back and then for the rest of the day I was working on preparing more training materials for one of the labs where we were running training. So I kept going with that till about 6 o'clock. And then I started pouring down rain late in the afternoon. But when I left the office it had stopped. So I caught my train home at about 15. Again changing at Strathfield and then back to Summerhill. Came home and did my usual thing. I put my son to bed. Gave him a bath. Gave him his bottle. He went to bed. He was in bed by about quarter past seven. And then we watched TV and had dinner. We didn't go for a walk like we usually do because it was raining. And so we just watched TV. I did a bit of maths and checked my emails. And I went to bed about 10.30. Right after my son to bed. So it would have been a quarter past seven. It was sort of an Italian salad with pasta and basil and tomato and bocconcini and some avocado. Yep, we watched Big Bang Theory and a bit of the 7.30 report. It was 6.30 and yes I did have cereals. Wheat bix. Yep. No. No. No. We do like them. We try and be healthy. No, we just for whatever reason we don't buy them. They're like reasonably healthy in the scheme of cereals. Probably got a bit of salt. A bit of extra salt and sugar like all cereals. A bit more than they need. No, they didn't have any fruit in them. They were the brand wheat bix. That's right. No. No. I got the train to Parramatta via Strathfield. Changed at Strathfield and went on to Parramatta. That's right. No, it was the 7.06. No, it was about 7.40. Hmm. Yes, we use SAP, a program called SAP, to clock all our times. That's right. The start and end of each shift. Yep. No, that's not right. No. I think so. I think the computer records, not just the time that I logged but one of the systems would have logged the actual time that that information was put in. So I think, and I might have sent some emails around that time as well. So those timestamps should confirm that I was here at that time. I believe so. Yes. Yes. Yep. I think I was there before. There must be some sort of mistake. No, I was definitely there before 8.30. No. No. Not yesterday. No. It has happened before. Yep. Yep. I guess you can see that it is, but sometimes we forget our passes and I think it's reasonable that your known colleagues who are employees of NSW Police could use your pass just to get in and out of the building. I was running training, so I was the trainer. The way around it was five crime scene staff and three from imaging. That's right. Twelve. Yes and no. They were a good group and pretty good, but the system we're teaching is a bit problematic so it can be tricky. That's right, except that it was pork, not beef. Not much. Not a big beef person, so no, not really. Six. Six o'clock. No. No. No, it was just an Italian salad with pasta and vegetables and things. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. It probably doesn't take much effort to be able to help my kid with his homework in future, so just the basics really. It was 10.30. Going which direction? So on the way... Yep. Takes about 15 minutes. No. Yep. I would have been. Yep. That's right. Yep. That sounds about right. Yep. No. No. No. No. I wasn't involved in any altercation. No. No. No. I wasn't aware of that actually.
