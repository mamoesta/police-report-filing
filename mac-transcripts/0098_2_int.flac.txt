 Okay, when I woke up, what time did I wake up? I think I woke up about 8.30. I then got my children breakfast. They had cereal and bacon and eggs and orange juice. I then did a load of washing, watched an end of a movie, then I went to go to my sister's place. I went to the swimming pool and yeah, swam there for a while. Yeah, it is. It's a public swimming pool. Then my nieces and nephew came over and that's pretty much shit. I went and got home, clothes off the line because it was starting to rain, but they're in time. I fed the dog. I then tried to get all the knots out of my daughter's hair and then made dinner. Then went to bed probably about 10 o'clock. What time did you get up? Chicken cacciatore, pasta and vegetables. That was about 7 o'clock? No, that was about 4 o'clock. Yeah, okay. Took the clothes off the line, folded the clothes, ironed some things, watched a spot of TV, cleaned up and started on dinner. No, I think about 8.30. No, cereal and eggs and orange juice. Yeah. Yes, I did. No, I did ironing later on in the evening. Harry Potter? Yeah. Yeah, at home. That's right. Yeah. I drove the car. That's right. Yeah, and I took my daughters. Yeah. No, no. No, I met them at the pool. Yeah, yeah, but they came later with their father. Yeah, with my sister. Yeah, all four of us went to the pool. Yeah, we all went to the pool. My two daughters and my sister went to the pool for about, oh, about three hours. Yeah, it was hot. Yeah, stinking hot. No, we had lunch before we left. Just salad rolls. It's probably about 1 or half past 12, something like that. Yeah, I think about 1. Yep. No. No. Yep. Did some washing. No. See the dog? No, don't have a cat. Yeah, they're okay. Yeah, they're okay. Just one. No, don't. No, didn't take the dog for a walk. No, it was probably a bit later than that. It was probably around about 7. I drove. Yep, my car. No. Yeah. Um, two. Yes. The blue. Yes, but not yesterday. No, just just me. Yep, about that. Yep, three hours. Yeah, there was a fair few. Yeah, the lifeguard was yelling at the children because someone was dive bombing them in the pool. No, there was someone else's. No, they were they weren't there for quite a while. They weren't there when it happened. They came later. Right. No, there was no altercation. No. No. He actually is good friends with my sister. No. No. No. Just friends, right? No, so it sounds like something that we would do, but we didn't. We would do. Someone was yelling at our children. We would stick up for our children, but it didn't happen yesterday. He spoke to my sister. I think they just said, G'day, how you going? Busy today? Nice weather for it. That's about it. Nothing else. No. Only to see him. I've seen him there last time I went to the swimming pool. No. No, I don't even know his name. Oh, just a few seconds just to just say hi and that was it. Not very, not long. Not a conversation. They didn't have a conversation at all. Not a lengthy one. Yeah, all together. Yeah. No. Together, yep. No, they just don't. They came and just went into the swimming pool. They dove in themselves. They're old enough to look after themselves swimming. No. No. No. No, they're good swimmers. They all just finished being at the river. No, it was probably about four. Yeah. Yeah. No, never seen them before. I don't know. I didn't look. I saw him talking to them and then after that, that was it. I was talking to my sister. We just didn't take any notice after a while. Um, no, I think he has to do what he has to do to get the kids to pay attention to him for their own safety. No comment.
