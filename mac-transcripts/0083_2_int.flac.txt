 Got up at about 10 o'clock, had a shower, then had breakfast. Then I went down to visit a friend who his wife's had a baby a few months ago. So I went to visit them. Was there until about 4. Then went back home, had dinner, went to bed about 9.30. Ah, no, oh, what? No, I didn't actually, no. I was just on the computer, just on Facebook. Sausages, barbecue, yep. Just onion, sausage sandwiches. True, yep. Just Vegemite and toast, not really, no. Think it was about 11 o'clock, yep. About 40 minutes. We got Subway for lunch. No, just one baby, yep. They live near the shops, so we just walked to the shops and got some Subway. No, no. When I got back to my place, after going to their place and before I had dinner, I watched like one episode of Modern Family. But apart from that, I didn't watch any other TV yesterday. No, I actually went with another friend. We both drove down together. No, he drove. No, in his car, yep. Not really, no. No, no. Saturday, I can't remember what I did during the day, but I went to the pub Saturday night and watched the soccer. Central Coast Mariners versus Brisbane. Central Coast, yep. Yeah, pretty good. And yeah, my team won, so I was happy. Yep, yeah, yep. No, I didn't. It was about, the game started at quarter to eight. I think we got to the pub about seven. No, I got a burger from a takeaway shop down near the beach. Yep. I can't remember exactly what time. I think it was about 2.30. Yep, yep. Yeah, I had a few. Yeah, we did play pool, actually. Yeah, it's all right. Probably prefer pool, but didn't play either. Nah, they've only got pool tables. Nah, I was just there with one of my friends. I walked from home. About 15 minutes. Nah, I walked home as well. Yep, about 10. Yep, nah, Vegemite on toast. Yeah, usually I have Wheat Bix. Yeah, it's all right. I don't really eat it very often. Yep, yep, yep, yep. Nah, I don't. I don't think so. Nah, I don't. Nah, I don't remember. Nah, I don't think so. I don't know what road you went on. I wasn't driving, so. Nah, not really. Nah, it was about 5-ish. Nah, subway. Yep. Nah, I think we just all got footlongs. That was the night before I had a hamburger. I just had sausage sandwiches last night. Yep. I was in Modern Family, but that was before I had dinner. Yep, just on Facebook. Nah, Twitter's for twits. That's all I've heard. Nah, I don't think that's true, but I haven't heard that. Oh, yeah. Nah, it was a bit earlier, actually. I think it was 9.30. Nah, I walked. Yeah, I didn't catch it. Nah, it's close enough to walk, so I never get taxis around there. Nah, Mariner's in Brisbane. I think it was 2.30, but I'm not exactly sure. Nightcomin'
