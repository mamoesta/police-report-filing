 What was yesterday, Monday? You got an easier question. What did I do yesterday? I had a shower, had something to eat, come into work, and then work till about 3 o'clock. Just after, then I drove up to pick my daughter up for her school formal. Drove her there and took a number of photos of her, her friends, et cetera, et cetera. And then came back to work, worked till about 10.30, then went home, had something to eat, then went and picked my daughter back up, and dropped her friend off, and then drove home and went to bed. Oh, crikey. Probably about 1.30-ish, a bit after, from work the first time. Yes, about 9. I think I had some toast and a cup of tea. I did? No. No. Just around about 10.30. No, I picked up. Yes, I did. Some grilled salmon, some salad. Probably about 2. I left work at 3, around about 3. Yes, correct. 10-hour shifts. Some toil in the middle. About 7-ish, around about 7. Straight away, went home first. Yes. Just some leftovers. What was it? Bristles, I think. Yeah, the night before that. Yeah. Yep, correct. Yep, about 9. No, not yesterday. Not yesterday, no. I had toast. No honey, no. Yes. Sorry, well, yeah, around about shortly thereafter. So both were close to 10.30. No, I think it was a bit later than that. It was about 2. No, salmon. No, no, I bought it from home. No, I left work about 3, quarter past 3. But I didn't drive two cars. I drove back to my place in the company car, and then took my car from there to pick up my daughter. Probably about 30 minutes. A little bit before, maybe about 3, 3.30. Yes. Yep. No, I didn't. No. Oh, the main streets, yeah. There is a Smith Street, but I didn't travel on it. No, no. Wasn't. No, that's not true. That's not true. No. No. Yep. Well, that wasn't me. Absolutely. Year nine. Well, I do, because they've just changed the system that there's no school certificate now in year 10. So the end of what used to be year 10 is now year nine, and the senior school is now year 10, 11, 12. Yeah. Yeah, but I think it's pretty standard across the board. There's no school certificate anymore. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so. Because you can't leave school now, unless you've specifically got a trade or whatever, until the end of year 12. You can't leave in year 10 anymore. The same as they stopped to leave in year 7, I suppose. I don't know. Trade or. Now you've physically got to have a trade or an apprenticeship or traineeship to go into. Otherwise, you have to do year 11 and 12. And 10. Well, 10. Yes, indeed. Formal. Yeah, I do, but more so year 12, I suppose. Yeah. Oh, did you? You know, we got, and in those days it was with the lapels and the bloody frilly shirts and all that sort of thing. Yep. No. Yep. I don't know why I'd be there. So possibly. No, no, no. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment.
