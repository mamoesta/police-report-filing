 Yep, okay, Saturday. What's today? Wednesday. Saturday I had the day off. Just wanted to remember what I did on Saturday four days ago. Um, I think I got up around seven and had to look after the kids for a couple of hours in the morning. I think I may have went, gone to Bunnings. I'm not 100% on that. Basically stayed home for the day from what I can remember. Uh, I'm probably just looking after the kids. Can't remember what the weather was like that day, so I don't know if I... I think it was a nice day from memory. So I probably just did a few things outside in the backyard. Can't remember exactly what. Possibly cleaned the pool. It's getting a bit dirty now. Um, stayed home. Stayed home at night time. Probably watched a bit of TV. Can't remember exactly. Uh, not specifically, but it would have either been cereal or toast. Sunday, stayed home in the morning. And Sunday afternoon at about 4.30. Oh, actually about 4 o'clock I went to the shops. Just got some groceries. Uh, walked over to the shops from home. And then at 4.30 I went to my in-laws house with my youngest daughter. And had to help them carry some... They had a council clean up. So I just helped them carry some stuff out to the front. They're on acreage to leave for the council to collect. There was an old lounge that was quite heavy. I had my... another relative helped me do that. Um, and had dinner there. And watched some of the Rugby World Cup grand final. Um, I think it was halfway through the second half when we left. Uh, drove home, which is about 20 minutes. And then had to get the kids ready for bed. Went to bed myself. Uh, probably got home about a bit before 9. Oh, it was probably 10.30. We had chicken schnitzel, mashed potato gravy, carrots and peas. Monday I had the day off again. And stayed home, looked after the kids. Uh, don't think... I actually took my youngest daughter swimming and left her there with... Sorry, my oldest daughter swimming, left her there with my youngest daughter, my father and my sister-in-law. I ducked off and went to Harris Farm to do some more grocery shopping. And then I went back to the swimming pool to pick them up and then went home from there. Uh, stayed home the rest of the day. Uh, from picking girls up from swimming, got home probably just before 12. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not sure. I can't remember if it was Saturday, but possibly. Maybe. Can't remember. I go there a lot, so it's possible. Uh, just may not have bought anything. May have just gone, had a walk around, let my kids play on the, uh, on the, um, playground there. Probably looked at some plants. Uh, as I said, I don't know if I was. It would have been morning if I did go. Uh, probably around 10. Yep. Uh, probably normally stay around 45 minutes. Uh, probably go nearly once a week, sometimes twice a week. Well, there's two close to me. Um, the ones... They're probably about similar distance. Uh, five-minute drive. Uh, depends. One's bigger, um, but the smaller one... The smaller one's in, like, a shopping complex, so it's, uh... Traffic can be harder there in the smaller one because there's a lot of other shops, although it's open area. So the bigger one's just by itself. Um, it's a bigger car park, so that's easier in that respect. But the smaller one's got the, uh, kids' playground. Um, they've got slippery dips. Uh, my daughter can't get up the slippery dip at the bigger one, so I actually have to climb in to, like, the tunnels and help her get up, which is quite difficult sometimes. So the smaller one, she can just climb up the stairs, so that's easier in that regard. Uh, the smaller one, I think I've been there the last few times I've been there. Yes. Yeah, it's only... It's not very many streets. Uh, as I said, I don't remember if I went, but that's just a guess if I did go. At home. No. No. Mm. Um, which Bunnings was it? The smaller one. Mm. Well, I can't recall if I was ever in the car, so I can't recall the incident. May have been. Can you tell me anything else about the incident? Mm. Mm. Yeah, there's sometimes cyclists where I drive, but I don't remember any. No, I don't. Yeah, that's right. On sa... I don't know. Possibly. Yes. Mm. Uh, well, I don't... I think I would remember if I hit a cyclist. Well, that would be something that would stay in my mind, I think. And I would probably... If I knew I hit them, I would stop. Mm. Uh, well, if I didn't know I hit it, yes, I could have kept on driving. Would there be any damage on my car? Oh, OK. I haven't noticed any, but I haven't checked it thoroughly since then. Where would the damage be? Uh, whereabouts? Front. I think there's some scratches there. I wouldn't know if it was the right one. Mm, no. It's at home. No, it's at the train station. Yes. No. Yes. My wife. Oh, I can't remember. Possibly. Right. She goes shopping a lot, so she could've taken it too. But she wouldn't have gone to Bunnings. Yes. Uh, yes, maybe. No comment. No comment. No comment.
