 Okay, my alarm clock goes off at 4.40 and I was working yesterday. So I got out of bed, had a shower, got ready for work, made my lunch, packed my work bag and I got in the car and then I drove to work. I got to work just before 6 and started my shift. So, attended the morning briefing and checked my memos, had some breakfast, had several people in and out of the office all morning, carried on with some work. I went to lunch at 12, took me to about 12.30. In the afternoon, obviously, just did a bit more work and I left the station at 4 o'clock. I drove home. On the way home, I stopped at our local shopping centre and then I left the shopping centres. They didn't have what I was looking for and then I went to get petrol. I stopped to get petrol and then I continued home and then that got me home about 5 o'clock, just after 5. And then what did I do? I checked my emails, potted around the house, got out of my work gear, had dinner at 6, put my son in the bath after dinner, so I was probably about 20 to 7, played with my son till about 7.30, put him to bed. Then I had a shower myself, washed my hair and I went to bed at 8.30. No. Yeah, I went, I got straight up. No. I used to. It's too hard, punishing yourself, pressing that snooze button. Oh no, I had my breakfast at the station. Ah, toast, two pieces of toast and a cup of tea. Yes. No. No. Ah, yes, yes, yeah. I started at 6. I drove. No. Ah, we park on the street. No. Ah, 12. Yes, yes. Ah, yes. No. Yeah. Ah, probably about 15 minute drive. A few, yeah. I don't know the name of it, but it's at Sylvania. I don't, I'm not sure. No, I went in and paid. Yes. Ah, card. Yes, it was definitely yesterday. Ah, five. Had dinner at 6. No, we had a barbecue, leftovers. I did, I know. I was thinking about that before. Um, yes, we did. I had leftovers, because we had people over the night before, so we had leftovers. Such a gourmet cook am I. Um, 8.30. No, always drive. There is, but at that time of the morning, it would be a very, very long trip. Yes. Ah, after. Ah, the briefing went for about 10 minutes. Yes. No, I made my lunch. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Yes. No. Ah, Sylvania. Just a little local shopping centre with a Coles and a Woolworths. No, I went to Kmart. No. No. I went straight to have a shower. I did last night. Ah, I don't know why I put myself through it, but yes, that's what I did. Black, sorry. No comment.
