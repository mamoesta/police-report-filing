 Oh jeez, I got up yesterday and I had a shower. I have two kids so I fed them breakfast and then I got them ready. I drove one to child care, then I drove the other one to school, to before school care. Then I drove myself to work. I worked all day. I had lunch at 11.30. I went down and got a Vietnamese roll with extra chili. Then I went back to work. I worked in the afternoon and then I left at three o'clock. I had to leave early because my husband was going to a Christmas party and I picked up the boys on the way home. No, he picked up the boys yesterday and then I got home and I did the vacuuming and then I mopped the floors and then I quickly did the sink because it was disgusting and there was someone coming to my house who'd never been there before. So I didn't want them to never come again. So I quickly did that and then my husband was picked up. I took the kids to McDonald's for dinner and then we came home and they had the McDonald's. They had a shower. Then they hopped in bed and I went to bed. I fed the dogs and I went to bed. That was about it. About quarter to nine, I had a Big Mac. That's disgusting but I did. And the kids had the popcorn chicken that they have now. I had that at about seven o'clock, six thirty seven o'clock. Yes, yes. I went out to get the McDonald's. Oh, roughly six thirty seven o'clock. I couldn't tell you. You live very far from McDonald's? Nope, only about a kilometre. So what time? Would have gone up about six thirty. No, I have breakfast when I get to work. So it's kind of more morning tea than breakfast. Toast, Vegemite. Okay, so what time? I started work yesterday about half past seven. Three now. Yes, the majority of the time my husband, I drive it, but my husband does drive it occasionally. To work at thirty. Yeah, probably about ten o'clock. And work. Yeah, I had lunch at about, probably by the time I got to buy it and get back and eat it, was about quarter past twelve. Forty five minutes. Yeah, well I went out and I had to go to the bank and then by the time I got to the shop, because I have a particular Vietnamese roll shop that I like, and by the time I got there, there was a queue. So I waited in the queue and then I had to walk back and then I ate my lunch. So yes, you said that you got up at about seven thirty? Yes, no I got out of bed at about seven, at six thirty and I got to work about seven thirty. Oh you got to work. Is there any way, a colleague of yours. They're lying. Is there any way you can do it? Yeah, I was seen on the way in by the duty officers. Do you log on? I do, but I don't always do that first straight away. Because that may. No, it would have been about eight o'clock. Um, do you, your. No. The car park we do, yes. It, it is recorded, but the, the security tags that were previously issued weren't issued to a person. They were just a tag number. So it wouldn't be identifiable about who has swiped that card. The, you were talking then. Yes, yes. So you started work, you had morning tea. Ten. Had um. Vegemite. Do you like. No, yes, no. Why don't you. Because it doesn't taste like Vegemite. Okay, so you've had your toast. Yes. And then you've gone back. Yes. You had um, lunch at about eleven thirty. We were, I went out to get lunch about eleven thirty. And um, you went shopping the. A Vietnamese roll. I don't know if they make Chinese rolls. I just. Spring rolls. Uh, spring rolls, yeah. But yesterday you had. A Vietnamese roll. You had. Yes. Um, you got back at about. No, I got back to work at about twelve thirty. Quarter past twelve, around there. Yeah, I did, yeah. And you left work at about four. No, I left work at three. Um, you caught the train. No, I drove. Drove your car. I did. Very, very rarely. So you drove your car. Yes. Um, but on the way home you.

And about four seven. No, it was McDonald's. Did you have to. Drive through. So um, do you remember um, when you went through the drive through. No, I don't. We received information, um, vehicle, um, as they drove, drive state order. Okay, that wasn't me. No. Um, aware that they. Good, I'm glad they do now. Okay, well, I measured that, um, and it actually shows, see a person actually ordering, see and that you can. The meal. Right. You've just driven. It's not true. No. The kids.
