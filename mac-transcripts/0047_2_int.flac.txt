 today. I woke up about 6.30 with the alarm, no 6 o'clock, 6 o'clock with the alarm and our car had to go for service so I um and I wanted to get there at 7 o'clock because otherwise you get in a bit of a queue and you can waste 20 minutes dropping it off so I thought well if I get there at quarter to 7 I can get in the line and be in there at 7. So I left home at 6.30 and I usually run home from where I dropped the car off. So I got there about quarter to seven and I waited for them to open the gates and I was the first in line which was good and they opened up I went in and I dropped the car off and then I ran home which takes about an hour or so from there but again that was rainy all the way so I ran running all the way home. Got home and I had a quick shower and I dropped the boys early to school because I had to go and get my hair cut so I dropped them early and drove over to my sister-in-law's place and got my hair cut and then I had to get back to the school because it was my eldest boy's presentation day so I went back to the school via home quickly picked up my husband and we went to school and we were late so we had to stand right at the back in the rain and watch the presentation for an hour and a half. So we watched that and we're looking at getting a barbecue for Christmas. So while we were at the presentation they said that their group were going to do a performance at 1.30 so I said well I'll come back and watch the performance which they'd forgotten to tell us all about so I thought I better come back and watch that so we thought we'll duck down to Tower and Point and have a quick look at some barbecues because we're getting a barbecue for Christmas and so we raced down there and had a quick look at some barbecues and then we went to Bunnings on the way back and had a quick look at some there but we couldn't find any that we liked and I dropped my husband home and then I raced back to the school to watch the concert so I just waited basically till my son's class had been done their thing and then I went back home and because I've been running around like a crazy person all morning I said I'm gonna have half an hour sleep I went and had a quick half hour lie down then I got up and got all this stuff ready for swimming and I went back and picked the boys up school and took them to swimming and I got them all settled in there and then I the car was in ready to pick up so I left swimming and went and picked my husband up and we drove back down to the car place and picked the car up and we went back and looked at another barbecue on the way back and then I went and picked the boys up and swimming and got home cooked dinner had dinner got ready for work today and finally sat down about nine o'clock for ten minutes and had a cup of tea and then went to bed now I've come to work today for a rest I think no actually I read the paper and you had a show on but I didn't watch it I think that Haven show which is terrible somewhere wolfie show or something super supernatural it's on 7-2 yeah no it's called Haven but it's on 7 it's only a new one that's been on a couple of weeks and I I watched it a little bit of it last week and I said I don't like it and then he said oh there's nothing else on I'll watch that so I read the Sunday paper because I didn't really want to watch it we had our pork and vegetable no yeah yeah whoever's home cooks dinner but then if we're both home which is unusual very unusual that we're both actually home together I cooked because he was putting insulation in the roof so he was still doing that while I cooked about quarter to six six o'clock yeah no six o'clock yes yeah I had to set it yeah it was my day off so normally I'd sleep in a bit more but I wanted to drop the car off early so I could have a run and then get back and go and get my haircut mm-hmm yeah yeah yeah Aaron a bit sometimes just a 90,000 corn was on it yeah it was due so um we dropped it in for the day for that and you drop seven o'clock seven now it's rain from the minute I was raining when I started it's alright once you started but not I don't like really starting running in the rain but I don't mind if you start and then it rains it's not so bad but I must say I don't really like starting right but I didn't kind of have a choice I was there and and that was it so yeah Oh about quarter past eight yeah no my sister-in-law yes yes yeah she does it from home yeah yeah might attend and barbecues galore but they didn't really have the one we wanted all they'd had a couple but they weren't they're a bit junky I don't want a huge barbecue I just want a small to burn a barbecue but I want a reasonable quality one but the small ones seem to be junky so I just we're no no I haven't been there no yeah that's a new one isn't it isn't it out at Liverpool way or something I don't think we've got any yeah okay no yeah yes yeah well I went back at the 130 and I then I went back to pick them up after school so yeah I went back to watch we're all doing a concert thing or each class was doing a little skit or a little song my boys class did thriller so they danced a thriller yeah this was good yeah and a couple of others did like a you know five minute little skit play so and so each class had done something yeah which was quite good another class did a poem sort of acted out a poem yeah no both cars are registered in my husband's name and that's a lease car so that's um yeah yeah you know other car yeah yeah wasn't too bad yep there was yep he drove in oh there's a few people coming in and out of Bunnings yeah people walking around no yes no no no no no no no no no no no there was no one there we didn't talk to anyone there straight in and did our shopping and came out we didn't speak to anyone in the car park yes I actually looked at that one last week and we went back to look at that one which I think I'm gonna ring and then there's a dozen in the shop and I said well we get it or won't we and I said well we'll see how many are here and the lady said there was a dozen so I said let's go home and think about it tonight so I think I'm going to ring him today and say just go and get the jolly thing because I'm sick of looking at barbecues just quietly I've looked at a lot of barbecues and obviously what I'm after it doesn't exist so I may as well compromise yeah I had we had a look at the Webbers but hmm no no yeah they had they had a really good one there but the grill part was like a really junky aluminium coated grill wasn't like a nice solid cast-iron grill if that had had the cast-iron grill we would have got that but it had this good hard solid hot plate on one side but then this junky aluminium grill on the other so we were all set to go down and buy that one but then when we got there I went that's really scungy so we yeah anyway it goes on and on and then we were looking for a certain size and we saw another one but then they also come in different burner strengths as well and the one that wasn't too bad was only a nine something burner and whereas a lot of the others were 16 so I thought well we should probably get this it's very complicated he doesn't even want one it's me that wants my because our junky one at home he's more than happy with but I just think it's messy and doesn't look very good so it's me driving the barbecue so yeah anyway no no it'll need a bottle and it needs a new bottle and we've only actually bought a new gas bottle for the old barbecue not so long ago but we'll have to get a different gas bottle for this barbecue because they have a different connector or something no apparently not apparently not got a new bar so that's another reason why you're saying I've just gone and bought a new gas bottle but never mind anyway that's life some pork chop yeah yeah no no just the Sunday paper that I haven't hadn't quite got to so I was reading that about 930 or no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment komeno comin no komino
