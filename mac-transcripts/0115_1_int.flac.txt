 Very hard to remember what I had for breakfast. I got out of bed at 4.30, had a shower, dressed, got in the car, drove to the train station, usually catch the 6.30 but I was there early so I got the 6 o'clock train. The train got me into Parramatta at about a quarter to seven and started work at seven and had a coffee at 10 o'clock and out again at lunchtime. Had another coffee, another coffee at two o'clock, lots of coffee. Left work at five o'clock, caught the train home, picked up my child from after school care, went home, had a beer, had some dinner, watched some TV, went to bed. I would have been about 9.30, 10 o'clock. I don't remember, I think it was one of my wife's shows that I tend to turn off on. Ah, yes, that's it. Yeah, Specs and Specs, that's it. One of our friends was actually in the crowd so we were, I remember now, yeah, trying to look in the crowd for her. No. Dinner last night, I honestly can't remember. Ah, yes, it was gnocchi pesto. I generally make the gnocchi but I wasn't home in time so, lunch. I had a roll from Benjamin's Bakery. Yes, yes it is. I own one personally, just the one, but my partner has another car. Yes. My wife occasionally, but mainly me. No. From the train station, oh sorry, from home to the train station and back. In the morning, yes. Ah, yeah, it was around 5 o'clock. Mm-hmm. No, it's free parking. Yes. New parking lot at the station that has been put in in the last few months. Straight in. Yes. No, it was the 6 o'clock train. Yes. Yep, that's right. The train, yeah, generally takes about 45 minutes. So, 45 minutes in, 10 minute walk to work, yes. Yes, yes. Um, I have once had my card, yes. My card? No. Really? I say that my colleague must be mistaken. No, I don't know, there might be some security cameras that may be able to verify that. I must be, I must have mistaken my time that I arrived at work then. Yes, there's one person there that is, he starts a lot earlier than I and he may be able to recall that. The colleague that you're speaking to. Yeah. The colleague that I spoke to. Yes. No, Benjamin's Bakery. Yes. It was pork roll. Mm-hmm. About 4, no, I think it was about 5. No, I never catch the bus. No. Yes. No, I got in the car, the car park, and um, and drove home. Yes. Yes. No, I picked him up on the way home. No. A couple of beers. Yes. When I do drink wine, yes. Red. Not generally, no. No. Nocchi pesto. No. I was too late. Hamster. No. It was Bixinspec. Yes. Yes. And was extra, it was an hour show last night instead of half an hour, so I think it was 8.30, 9 o'clock. But I may have gone to bed then, I think. I don't generally watch it, but I think it was, I think it starts at 7.30, I think. Mm-hmm. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment.
