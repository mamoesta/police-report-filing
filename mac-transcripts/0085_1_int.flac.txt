 I've got to remember yesterday. What was it, Thursday? I woke up, I got dressed and I got my pre-prepared lunch and breakfast out of the fridge, out of my partner's, put it on the kitchen table, put the dogs out and then packed our bags and jumped into the car and fell asleep on my way to work. I was being driven in, got to work, I logged onto the computer, had absolutely no idea what I did yesterday. Had a chat to the boss, went out somewhere. Oh, I went to Sydney Police Centre, did some things with exhibits there, went to court, did some things with court there and then drove back here, being police headquarters and pretty much probably read some memos and went home. Went to the hairdresser, played with the dogs, ate dinner, went to bed. I think it was 4.30. Actually, there we go, I actually went out for breakfast yesterday morning with work and I had a breakfast wrap with bacon and eggs. Yes, yes they are. 2.15, 10.50, 7am. I'm up the Central Coast so it takes about an hour and a half. We get here a little bit early, sometimes it takes a little longer. Yeah, about 8 o'clock, about 11 o'clock, about 2.30. Ah, no, no, we just didn't really have, well just snacked, didn't have lunch, sit down, lunch or anything. 4 o'clock, up the coast. No, no, I could have lived home. Got home about 6 o'clock. 6 o'clock. An hour and a half. 8 o'clock, yeah. No, no, no, my partner had done all that so no. Well, I don't, we actually live on acreage so taking the dogs for a walk really doesn't happen, they work themselves. Um, yet to find them, we've moved in only six months ago. So we've found some little baby ones but nothing big yet. I've got a German Shepherd and a Staffie. Yeah, I didn't, I was wrapping Christmas gifts so I didn't really take much. No, that's what we were watching, I've got absolutely no idea what was on TV. Yep, chicken and salad. No. 10 o'clock. Yeah, I dare say so for a short period of time. A novel. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. That's untrue. Yes. Ah, my duty book, my roster and my work colleagues. Yes. No. Nope. Yes. No. Um, I followed the person that gave me a lift in. That would have been about the time I went for breakfast. No. No. Down in Centre. Yep. No. No. Ah, Sydney Police Centre, Surrey Hills. No. No. Ah, I didn't have lunch. I snuck. I had a bit of a sandwich left over from yesterday. Had a bit of that the day before. Had a bit of that. Um, probably, I don't actually recall. So, obviously nothing too exciting. Yeah, 4pm, roughly. Ah, it was no different than usual. So, getting out of Sydney's usually pretty bad. So, once you get on the freeway it's fine. No. Woo-woo. No. I got the dry biscuits out and put them in the dog bowl. Does that classify feeding them? Yep. I got half of it, the other half put the dog food in, the rest of the dog food in and took it out. So, I did half of it. Yes. Ah, yes. Yes. No. What vehicle was that? Which one? Oh, okay. The only reason why I asked, there's probably about 50 different police that go up there on the freeway around the same time in police cars from here. Oh, okay. Not at all. Nope. Yep. No, that's untrue. You're making that up. Nope. Yep. Yes. No. I've had chicken and salad. Not a chicken salad. Chicken and salad. Not a chicken salad. About 10. Yep. No comment. No comment.

That's my channel for Spanish. I'm going to be putting up with triangle chips for a while, but I like most things for christmas. Like our little family of five that I usually do and try. We don't get any more.
