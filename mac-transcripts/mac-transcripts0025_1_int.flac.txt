 Okay, well I started the day by reading my book in bed. I'm currently reading The Power of One by Bryce Courtney. I'm almost to the end. And then of course I got my cup of tea in bed, which I always get from Hubby. Then we did breakfast, ironed, and then I had a girlfriend and a husband come over. They drove their Mustang and we did cheese platter and bottle of wine out the front, which I live on the river. And then my sister popped in by boat as she does, and so she joined us. And then we did a quick curry and watched the footy. Woke about seven and didn't get out of bed till about 8.30. No, we had bacon and eggs yesterday. Didn't have lunch. We just did the cheese platter thing at about 2.30 and they left about 4.30, about 5.30, quarter to six. Saturday. Woke up and helped Hubby pick up a gym that we bought from Gumtree at Richmond and then came home, helped them put the gym together, and then went and had lunch with some girlfriends at Cherrybrook. And then did a little bit of, oh, well, what would you call it? Window shopping, looking for an outfit for a cruise I'm about to go on, but didn't find anything. And then headed home and my husband's son's friend came over and we had dinner and I don't even know what we watched on telly. Just an early night, I think. I can't remember. He did our curried pork fillets with a mustard sauce and veggies, peanut butter and jam sandwich. My favorite. Yeah, yeah, it was just home. Saturday night, just had dinner at home. Yeah, yeah. I don't even, couldn't even tell you what we watched. I don't even remember. So last night, what? About 8.30. No, we watched half of it and went to bed. No. Yes. Have two boats. Yes, we've just started ski racing. So that's one boat we've just bought to do that. And the other boat is our social ski. Oh, I went skiing on Saturday. I forgot about that. So there, yes. Had Monday off, did something with my mum and worked Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. I have Fridays off. Went to Windsor, just did a bit of shopping and then came home because I had a guy come out to do a kitchen quote because I'm getting a new kitchen. And then we went and did pizza on Friday night at our local pizza place. So that. No, I woke up about 7, 7.30. No, I read my book. Later on that afternoon. No, girlfriend and a husband. What's a Mustang? It's a car. There's actually a, it's made by Ford and there's a fastback two-door, which needs lots of work. Yeah. And the plane? My sister came over in her boat. Yes. It was down the river. Yes, yep. And she saw that we were home and popped in. And I said to her, she knew that the wine had just been opened and she had a class. So when your friend stayed- Now we had a day bought over, a cheese platter. So that's right. We said, I'll come and I'll bring nibblies. I said, fantastic. More than welcome. And then last- No, I don't eat chips. So we had a curry. Don't know, it comes in a box. It's very easy and very delicious. Just a, I think it's Japanese, but it can't be a Japanese curry. I think it's an Indian curry, just with beef and veggies. Yeah, made the rice. Yep. Yeah, we made it. No, at 8.30. Yeah. And on Saturday- Saturday. No, went to Richmond on Saturday. Yeah. That was on Friday. Yeah. No, I'm going to a cruise to Melvin Cup. So I was looking for that. Hmm. And then you had- Yes, I did. No, I just went dress shopping and didn't find anything. And then something- And then you didn't buy? No, I didn't buy. No, that was bacon and eggs yesterday. No, that was peanut butter and jam sandwich. Hmm. Yes. And then on Saturday- Yeah, in the afternoon, I did. When I came home from lunch, they had the boat set up, ready to go. So I just jumped in and we went for a ski. Hmm. No, probably only a couple, just before the sunset. Yeah. On- No, we had pork and veggies. That was Friday night. Hmm. Last night- Yes, for some time, yeah. But I don't know what we watched. I don't remember. How many minutes better? No, I don't even know what time I did. It must have been about 10-ish, I think, on Saturday night. Yeah. So last- Watched a little bit. But I think, did we even make it to halftime? I don't even know if I did. I don't remember. We were losing and I lost interest. Yeah. All right, I'm just- Mm-hmm. Yep. No comment. No comment.
