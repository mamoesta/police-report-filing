 Ah yeah, we probably woke up at about 7.30. The kids had a friend over from the night before for a sleepover, so they were all in the lounge room playing Wii. Got up and went downstairs, had some porridge for breakfast, tried it with milk this time, had a cup of coffee with it, hung some washing out, said hello to the dog, called my daughter down and put her hair up because she had a dancing estedford that day. So we sat and did all of her hair, then told her to clean her teeth, then she came back down and I started applying her makeup, then she had another friend arrive that was coming to the estedford with us, then I ran upstairs, no, then the parent of the other child arrived to pick her up, then I ran upstairs, had a shower, then ran back downstairs and finished the makeup. Then we were off to the estedford and she came first in a group of four and so then after the estedford we went to the service station and we had ice creams, chips and the girls had milk and lemonade for lunch, nice and healthy. Then we went back home and met the boys and my hubby who'd been at soccer presentation and I had a quick bite to eat, then the girls practiced a dance routine to show us while my hubby was studying and I was, I must have been busy doing something.
