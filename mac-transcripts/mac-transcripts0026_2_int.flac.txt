 Yesterday was Wednesday. What did I do? Oh, I just actually got up late yesterday. I was running a bit late. And I got up and had a shower, got dressed and walked straight to work. Because I've moved now, so I've left my uniform at work. And I just went straight into work and got changed and signed on and started work. And then I had a forum yesterday at work. And a compass forum, so I helped with that all day, which was fairly tiring. And then I finished at 5.30 and I got changed and I walked home. And just plonked on the lounge, unpacked my boxes a little bit and had dinner and had a few drinks and went to bed. Probably quarter past ten, some bruises, orange and lime bruises. I would have got up at 5.30 in the morning. I was late, yeah, because I had to be at work at 6, so I just sort of raced away. So did you have any breakfast? No, not yesterday. The forum we are catered for, so I just grabbed a few of the sandwiches that are supplied. What was on the sandwich? Smoked salmon and capers and salad were on a few, an egg and there was another one with ham and salad. And those little triangles, I probably had about four of those little triangles. So then you worked till 4 and then you worked till 5? Yes. So what time? Just before 6. And you met Sunday? I went and visited a girlfriend up the coast. I travelled up to, I actually stayed over the night before from a girlfriend's house in Camperdown. And I got up from her house and drove up to the central coast at about 8 o'clock. And just had brunch with my girlfriend up there who I hadn't seen in six months. And just had a chat, went back to her house. And then I left and came home and sort of unpacked through the afternoon. I think about 1 o'clock or 1.30. And um... Probably about 3 o'clock. And when you got in... No. Yes. 1. No. You arrived? No. So you said that you stayed at a friend's house? Yes. No, Camperdown. And so you got up early? Yeah, got up at about 7, had breakfast there and left at 8. Oh, okay. What did you... Just toast. Toast with a Vegemite? Vegemite, yeah. So you left there at about 8? Yes, yep. And you didn't go home before going? No, I just went straight up. So can you remember what you did on Sunday? Oh, we went out, we had a cocktail night at a cocktail bar in Newtown. And there was a happy hour, so we just had cocktails there. And then we went to the Cooper's Arms or something hotel and had a jug of Pim's there. And then went to the Bank Hotel. Oh, we had Vietnamese for dinner. And then just went to the Bank Hotel and had a bit of a dance and then we walked home. So what, to probably 1am on Sunday morning? Had you had a lot to do? Probably did, but by the time I finished I was pretty sort of nearly sober, I think, sort of, walking home. No, no. No, because you only need to turn the corner from the main street in Newtown. So, just going back to yesterday morning. Oh, yesterday morning? No, 5.30. 5.00, and you caught a bus? No, what? You walked? 15 minutes. So that means you'd have woken up? No, got in at quarter to 6. And then... Oh, sorry, yeah, do you mean I got up at 5.30? Yeah, I would have, like, rushed. I probably would have got in just at 6, yeah. 6.00? Yeah, right on sort of 6 at work, yeah. Okay, so not... No. A colleague has told me that you... Oh, no, that can't be right. I also did the forum yesterday, and I helped out people at the forum at about 7.00. So why did you... Oh, because I wanted to get in early and make sure I was down there before 7, when they opened the doors to the auditorium where we've got it set up. So I like to get in early. Okay, so you started to see a little party, pies and skewers? No, sandwiches and things like that, and chicken skewers. Skewers. Yeah. So you didn't have any roast beefs? Oh, I think there were some there, but I didn't eat any, yeah. So you worked the forum all afternoon? All day, yeah. And then probably finished at the actual forum at about, probably about 1.30, but worked in my normal office until 5.30. Oh, I see. Yes, yeah. And then you caught the bus home? No, I walked home. No, 15 minutes. So you got home just before 7.00 p.m.? Oh, just before 6.00. Oh, and then you packed up as you were moving? Oh, I moved in, so I'm trying to unpack there. Yeah, I've got boxes in my house, so I'm just trying to unpack my house. And then you had a couple of... Oh, Bacardi Breezes in those bottles, yeah. Just had more than a couple. So you had Bacardi? No, Bacardi Breezes. Oh, Breezes. Yeah, they're with orange and, yeah, orange flavor or whatever. So you went to bed at... About 10.00, quarter past 10.00. Did you read any book recently? No, I just went to try to go to sleep. So then on Sunday, you drove up to... Yes. So as you were approaching Mount Y, do you remember seeing a group of... No, no, I don't think so. Do you remember a nail had gone with a yellow stripe down... No, not that I remember. How many vehicles? Only one. Okay, you're not... Yes. We've received information of a vehicle name seen and a person driving that involved in an incident on Sunday. Oh, was it me? No. Wasn't you? No. Are you aware that there's safety? Oh, I wasn't aware, no. Have you reviewed the safe footage? We've got photos of a vehicle standing inside of... Oh, I think I must have stopped to help someone. I think they said they got hit by a car or something, and I just stopped to help. So that's when I'm for or against... I forgot, yeah, sorry about that. So the information that we've received from the witness, the vehicle and from another, is that... No, it was actually another car nearly hit me and pushed me into the... or made me sort of go near the cyclist, and I think they fell off their bike, but I didn't hit anyone. You didn't actually? No. Is there any damage? No. No. And when did you last see any damage? I didn't really inspect it, but I'm pretty sure there's nothing on there. There's no damage.
