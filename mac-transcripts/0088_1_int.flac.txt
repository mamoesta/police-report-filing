 I was very lazy yesterday, I had a day off. So I didn't get up until about 10 o'clock. And then I read a book most of the day. Dropped my sister off at work at about 11 o'clock to sign some paperwork. Drove around for a little while, picked her up, went back home, read my book again. And then about six o'clock, started making dinner, and then watched TV and went to bed. Did you have any food at lunch? I don't really remember. I did. I don't remember what it was. You can't remember what you had for lunch? Mustn't have been too exciting. And what did you have for lunch? Chicken wings, some broccoli and corn. Junior MasterChef, burn notice, and I don't think anything else. Did you go to bed? About 20 past 11. And did you read it all? Yes. Did you have breakfast? Yes. Again, I can't remember what did I have. Sorry, what was it? I'm trying to remember what I had. So what did you do the day before? I worked at the children's court. I worked at the children's court. Oh, OK. What time did you get there? 8.30, quarter past 10, train, car. Train and? Car, then a train. Yeah. What time did you have lunch? About 3.30, quarter to 6. Weekend shift, yeah. And then you caught the train back? Yes, and then drove home. And? Yeah, Junior MasterChef again. I'm not sure. Kept flicking between the channels after that. OK, what's your? 10. And do you remember what time? I think I went to bed about 10, but I read again. What's the name of the book? I think it's Seeds of Space. I can't remember the author. Seeds of? Seeds of Earth, sorry. Not Seeds of Space. Seeds of? Yes. So you were saying that yesterday morning you got up at about? No. Yesterday? No, about 10. And cereal? No. Do you have abs? Oh, occasionally. Not very often. Do you like promite? I haven't had promite. Marmite? No. Sorry, where were we? You asked about marmite and promite. Oh, yeah. And when you said you dropped your sister off, did you drive your car? Yes. Carriage? Yes. OK, does anyone? My sister occasionally. Did she drive it at all? No. So what time did you drop? It was about 11 o'clock, I can't remember the exact time. And did you just drop her off, or did you? I dropped her off and then drove around the block. No, I drove around and then picked her back up, because there's no parking outside her office, I couldn't wait there. So I drove around while I was waiting. Then you dropped her off? Yeah, I dropped her off. She had to sign some paperwork and then come back home. Oh, wasn't she going to work? No. Oh, I thought she was going to work. No, no, no. OK, so you didn't actually park the car in her house? No, no. Yeah. So what time did you get back home? About half an hour later. And you said that you started to read your book. It was a book. Same book? Yes. And you read that all day? Yeah, it's a thick book. So you had dinner at about 5? I think it was about 6 I started cooking. So it probably wasn't until about 7. Sorry, what? It was until about 7 o'clock that I ate. Oh, and then you what, come dine with me that evening? No, Junior Master Chef. Junior Master. And that's? No, Channel 10. You went to bed at about 10.30? It was about, yeah, 20 past 11. 20 past 11. Roughly. And there you went on to your, in bed, while you were in bed. No, no, I was reading my book again. Oh, OK. Do you have a scan? Yes, I do. Do you have a? No. Have you ever been on Twitter? No. So the day before that, you worked? Yes. And you got into work at about 9.00? No, about 10.15. Do you have a security pass? Yes. So on that day, you would have used security? Yes. A colleague of yours told me you actually. No, no. Is there any way you can verify that you didn't? No, other than talking to the sheriff at the court. They would have seen what time I came in. Is there any security? Yes, there would be. And did you swipe? Yes, when I went through the door upstairs, yes. Do you ever loan your card? Yes, it's a communal card. Oh, it's a communal card. So it's not just your card? No, no. It's about five of us that use it. But there is CCT, then? Yes. OK, we've actually looked at that. And it actually shows you coming through into the building at 9.00 AM. The timestamp must be wrong. No, we've checked with the, and it's been calibrated. Time is. I have no explanation for that then. We're just investigating in the morning. And you've stated that we're actually building at 9.00. Well, that's not true. No. OK, is there anyone who can verify what? Like I said, other than the sheriff seeing me walk in, no. Did you actually? Yes. Is there anyone else, a colleague? No. Well, the prosecutor's come in and out of court, but they're not always in. All right, we'll just make a few other queries for you. Mm-hmm. What is your? No comment. Is your address? No comment.
