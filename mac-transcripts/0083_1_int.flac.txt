 I slept in until about 10 o'clock, went into the city, in the afternoon I went to the beach, went for a swim, then went home, had dinner, watched some TV, brushed my teeth, had a shower. About 10.30? Yep, I had, actually bought some Milo cereal. Yeah, it was really nice. Usually I have Wheat Bix but I thought I'd change it off a bit. Milk? Yes, milk, yep. Pretty much, yeah, it's almost like eating Milo for breakfast. About 12. By bus. Had a shower, brushed my teeth, had a shave. Yep, about half an hour. I just met up with a friend. No, I didn't actually, no. That was about 3, 3 or 4 o'clock. I caught the bus home and then I drove to the beach. Yep, yep, yep. I guess it would have been about 3, 3 or 4. I pretty much got home and then went straight to the beach after that. About 5 minute drive. Yep, yep. About 8 o'clock. A burger from a takeaway shop near the beach. Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, the other way around. Yep, about 7.30. I was watching a snowboarding video. No, it's a DVD. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I bought it. About an hour. About 8. I had an exam this morning so I was just studying, reading over some notes for that. Yep, I think I said 10 o'clock. Yep, yeah, if I have to work I get up at 4.30. Oh, not always. Nah, I said Milo, Milo cereal. Yep, a bus. Yep, no, I don't. Yeah, just one friend, yeah. Oh, that was for dinner. I didn't really have any lunch. Yep, yep, yep, one. No, no one. I do have a brother but he has his own car. Yep, no, I don't let anyone drive it except me. Yep, yep, yep. Yep, street parking, yep. Nah, nah, I don't know any Smith Street. Yep, on the route I take, yep, I do. Nah, nah, I didn't drive on Harris Street. Nah, I didn't. Nah, nah, I must have missed him. Yep, yep, oh yeah. Nah, I don't remember that, no. Nah, I don't, I think it must have been someone else. I parked up the road from work. Nah, nah, I saw it this morning and didn't have any. Nah, nah, nah, it's been a few months. Yeah, nah, I think I'd notice it. I reversed into my garage so I saw the front of the car this morning. Nightcummin'
