 Yeah right okay no that's fine I'll just I'll go off and attend if I need to. When I got up I had a shower I got up at 6.15 had a shower and got dressed had breakfast spoke to my one of my kids briefly and then went and got into the car and drove to the station parked the car and missed one train because I was on the wrong platform and got the next one and while I was on the train I read a book a book I'm reading quite a long book and got to Parramatta came in I think I got here at about 10 to 9 so a little bit later than I'd like came in and started work did some routine stuff first and then talked to the team leader and then started talking about some one-off work she wanted done and when it did some more routine issues and then started dealing with this project work if you like and asked a few more questions some clarifications and then continued with it spoke to a detective later in the day he wanted some information I said I've already provided it and he said yeah but I want it you put like for example you put in box B I want it in box A okay all right I'll put in box A for you so I did that and had an early day yesterday because I go bike riding would try and go bike riding one evening a week with friends so I left early I left about three and met with my friend and we went bike riding and unlike the vast majority of Sydney we didn't we yeah we we copped a bit of the rain but it was very little and I only got home to hear that you know the trains have been knocked out on the bridge and there's all sorts of dramas and I came through a few hours earlier so I guess I consider myself very fortunate in that regard because I heard some people were trapped in the city so that would have been frustrating so it was probably worthwhile leaving work early yeah had dinner with my family and and then I was on the computer and put the kids to bed and the younger kids to bed and and spoke to my wife about some issues with one of the kids at school and and for a while we talked about that and how we're gonna how we're gonna try and deal with it nothing dramatic but yeah how we're gonna deal with it and then we went to bed not long after and that was it I went to bed at about 10 a little bit uh a little bit yeah but not for me personally not a great deal no oh yeah NCIS silly stuff yep we had um chicken patty burgers yes I had cereal uh just wheat vicks and another cereal on the top of it with milk that's pretty much all I've got time for um yeah what is it I'm not even sure the name some hoops thing whole grain hoops yes about 12 30 sandwiches uh well I know that I make them myself uh I had uh salami and lettuce uh no I had to go out and do some stuff in Parramatta so I just took it with me and ate it out there 6 15 no no I did not no eggs on toaster no that'd be too unhealthy for me yeah yeah oh look I do because it's easy and it's quick and you can get out of the house in time yeah in winter I do yes uh yeah Uncle Toby's you know you pour it into a bowl you pour the water on top you put in the microwave away you go hmm no a bit after that what time no about before nine what time do you usually start work look ideally 8 30 yeah it was what bus yeah no I don't get a bus I get the train uh no there's no buses from where I come from yeah to here yeah yeah I caught the I drove to the station caught the train to work and um and then walked up from the station well yeah I've heard I've heard this sort of thing said before but there's a guy that looks like me in the building yeah so and people do get us confused I'd say yeah I'd say there's um I'd say there's a problem with the system because I wasn't here at 7 30 at 7 30 I was on a train I was actually waiting on the station for my train and I've got I can prove that I can my wife can validate what time I left home I talked to my daughter um in the morning at 7 20 so I couldn't have possibly got from my house to here in 10 minutes so the the the assertion you make is can't be substantiated right which colleague is this yeah I mean people will say what they want to say but they can't prove it that it's it's my word against theirs and I can prove that I wasn't here I'm quite comfortable with that and I think that'll back up the fact that I wasn't here have you wasn't me no there's there's there's digital um images can be uh doctored and and possibly that's what happened for what reason I don't know I don't know no idea someone might have had in for me yeah I don't know yes no no salami and lettuce no and he went well I'll do until it runs out at home then I'll try something else yeah I left work at about three actually no no no not motorbikes hmm not in north sydney no I didn't say where I went but it wasn't north sydney I didn't yeah had dinner with my family yeah chicken patty burgers patty burgers yeah 10 30 10 10 10 right right no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment No comment.
