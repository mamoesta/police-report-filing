 Right okay yesterday was Thursday wasn't it? So I got up and then I got ready for work. I had cereal for breakfast. I had muesli mixed with some wheat bit and some auburin and light milk and I watched channel 9 sunrise while I was having my breakfast. I then went and had a shower and got dressed for work found out that it was going to be not such a hot day so that was okay I could wear some pants that was a dilemma what am I going to wear. Then I could walk to work. I met some mates at work and had coffee. I then went up to my level five and logged in and had a normal day and at lunchtime we all the bunch of us decided to have Korean for lunch so that was a drama trying to get everyone together trying to get the money what's everyone going to order who's going to go and get it anyway by one o'clock finally we all get our act together we met on level two and it was about eight of us we had Korean which was a very noisy lunch but it was fun. Then back to work and at four o'clock I finished because I met up with my daughter who was in here at headquarters doing an EDW course and I wanted to say goodbye to her because today she's leaving to go to Thailand for two weeks holiday and so I wanted to be a mum and wish her good luck and bon voyage. Then I go home and because I'd had such a late big lunch I didn't really have much for dinner I just nibbled on stuff and and packed because I'm moving into my daughter's place today to stay at her place to look after her cat so I got some clothes ready and just did stuff like that packed up the laptop cleaned up a little bit did a load of washing and went to bed at about 9 30 and read channeling for half an hour and tried to put my channeling and meditation into practice and went to sleep. Um would have been about quarter past six uh yesterday would have been about quarter past seven no I walk to work I live 10 minute walk away so I walk to work I catch the bus when I'm going into the city but when I'm working in headquarters I walk no very rarely usually it's the bus um grocery shopping well it would have been on Sunday I go I went to Coles I never say never rarely actually when I work in the city if I need anything on the way home I stop at Woolies then because it's handy but generally I go to Coles um I have yeah yeah in Parramatta sometimes I go around there but I need just to get basic stuff because they don't have a wide range of things no I left home at 7 15 got to work here about 7 30 got a coffee met my friends for coffee and hung around had a chat with them and then would have got at my desk at about 8 15 so I I sign on at 18. Oh by the time they got their act together it was about one Korean um once a month I eat Chinese I know I finished at 4 p.m yesterday my daughter my daughter yeah to Thailand two weeks no she hasn't been overseas no I haven't no not fussed to go there really no no oh is Tahiti America does it belong to America don't remember it was that long ago but there's America on the whole I haven't been oh no I got home about 4 30 quarter to five yeah yeah her cat and she doesn't have a dog no yeah she did actually yeah minty yeah uh no I went to bed at about 9 30 I read my channeling book Sunday mornings I might it's been a while though because I live on my own so by the time I get up and go and get the paper it's not really worth going back to bed uh no I got up at about a quarter past six I left home at quarter past seven no never have eggs on toast for breakfast during the week when I'm at work that's a weekend delight I had muesli and auburn and wheat bix all mixed together no no it was channel nine sunrise don't like koshi so I don't watch channel seven well what's the one called on channel nine I thought it was the other way around the one on channel nine is with um Carl and Lisa whatever that one is that's the one I watch because I don't like koshi now walk yeah I caught the bus on Wednesday that went in the city um yeah yes I would say that um they really wouldn't know because I'm a I work on my own so they wouldn't have any idea what time I start well that would be the time that I actually turn my computer on I think if they really wanted to track back through records they could see that I'd actually logged on at that time um do the through the yes yeah yes I did so that's another way I suppose but then that wouldn't give me a true time of starting work because I would have come in and met up with some mates and had coffee so just because I'm here doesn't mean I've started work so I don't log on until I actually I don't sign on until I'm actually at my desk yeah that's right um I could probably prove that I was on before that just by the work that I would have done I would have had emails that I would have sent and so they would show a time before nine o'clock because that's generally the first thing I do is respond to any emails that have come to me overnight so they would have a time on it well then there must be something wrong with the um with the computers and you know if this is an issue that you want to look at we will look at it no uh apart from the usual good mornings but I wouldn't have been saying good morning it's quarter past eight or to just say good morning so I would be able to tell you who was here at that time yes definitely yeah no trouble no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment
