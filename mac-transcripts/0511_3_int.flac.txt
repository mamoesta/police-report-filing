 No, I know. It's been like that for the last three weeks. It's not normally like that. I like... I'm happy with it. Yesterday I had water with some alcoholic liquid. It tastes so good. Alright, mate. So you reckon you had a big weekend as well? No, no. Not a big weekend. Just a big Friday night. Dude, I was hearing you. Alright, tell me about your Friday night then. Go. Um, well, I just went into town to catch up with Kate, who's... is it a farewell? Yeah, I met her. Yeah. Oh, that's right. Yeah. So, yeah, just went in there and had a few drinks. And I was going along fine until my friend started feeding me beer. What was it? Oh, you know, when you get to a point where you go, I can't... I've had too much. I've had enough. I don't want any more. And they start, here, get this India. Get this India. So... Yeah, what were you drinking? Just Grulsh. Well, that was the only thing that came in pints. The stuff was going back to the bar so many times. And this was at the... Yeah, Hockey Tongs, yeah. Where else? Um, we left... I can't remember what time we left. About 12.30 or 1 o'clock. And went and got some Sambreros. And then had that. And then caught the taxi home. And then went to sleep. Alright. You didn't go to any after or anything like that? Nah. Nah. You just went, alright, keep going. And then, what, Saturday? I was too hungover to do anything, so I just laid on the couch. Very evanful. Yes. Literally, that's probably what we did all day. Like, what? Oh, the missus as well. She was not... she was there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, she was there. Alright, got it. Um, and then, so Saturday night we just cooked a barbecue and got a movie. What movie? Paul. Oh, Paul. It's this little alien guy where Seth Rogen does the voice. There was shit... no, there was really, literally nothing to pick. It was pretty ordinary. Pretty slim pickings. Dude, just throw away, mate. Ha ha ha ha ha. God, it's a wrap. Ha ha ha. Um, and then, so that was it. Then Sunday is just, uh, chores around the house. Out to lunch. Um, we went to Trilogy at Woden. And then, I just went to Bunnings. And then came back. Gemma's... my brother-in-law came over for, like, just a cup of coffee, Sunday afternoon. And then, quiet night, watching him cooking dinner and watching telly. Uh, Ringer. Oh, some new show with Sarah Michelle Gellar. And then... Oh, that one. And then Seven. The end of Seven. Ha ha ha. He's just getting old, yeah. Yeah. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Alright, and then what did you have for dinner that night? Last night we had, yeah, roast lamb. Roast lamb. Yep. Okay, um... Uh, nah. Ha ha ha. Alright, I might as well just ask you. So Friday night was pretty fun, was it? Yeah, yeah, it was good. So you guys, um, you guys didn't have any drinks, did you? No, we just went straight into there. Yep. We did, actually, yeah. We had dinner, had some dinner before we went in there and all this stuff. Uh, we just had an early dinner at home. Okay. Um, drinking Grolsch beer then? Yep. No, not the girls. The girls were drinking Sangria or wine or something like that. Sangria. Ha ha ha. I don't know. I think everyone was looking after themselves. I bought one for the guest of honour, but that was about it. Yeah, you know. Yeah, okay. You reckon everyone was drinking out of pints? Oh, the guys that were in the shop, yeah. Uh-huh. So you weren't even going to the toilet quite a few? Uh, no, not heaps. Nope. I didn't smash ten pints. I didn't smash ten pints. That's what I want to know. Ha ha ha. I did not. It's recorded. You said you were. Ha ha ha. No, not ten pints, but um, no. Five? Maybe five. I can't remember by the end of the night. Okay, that's seven, isn't it? Ha ha ha. Alright, so you reckon that your friend, you had bar table wine? No, no, no. Oh, well, I wouldn't, well, maybe binging, I suppose, yeah. And you didn't eat? No, I think we left before they left. I'm getting too old, mate. You're barely older than I am. Ha ha ha. Alright, and then you said Saturday you were putting over. Yep. This is on the couch. Yep. On a Friday. Pretty much, yeah. The whole day. Well, not the whole, well, obviously not the whole day, but yes, a large chunk of the day. Alright. How come did you guys wake up? I just, I see you got up hungover. Yeah, pretty much. You're not dead? No, no, no, no, on the couch you can watch some crappy TV and snooze in and out. That is some worse things. You didn't have a greasy breakfast that morning? No, actually I had a haircut, so I had to go, that's why I was up, because I had to go get ready for a haircut. I just walked, walked down. More unusual? Oh, not much more than usual. No? No. Fair enough. Then you said this day, you did a lot of chores around the house. Yep. You said you went to Bunnings that day, so there was a lot of... Oh, I just got some lights for the bathroom, like the heat globes and stuff. Oh, so you didn't walk that much? No, just the globes. Alright, and then you said your brother-in-law over? Yep. Oh, I just... Oh, no, talked about trying to pick a horse for the Melbourne Cup tomorrow. And who will be that? Oh, I haven't picked anyone yet. Maybe, is it Dunner Dane or something like that? Dunner Dane. Yeah, Dunner Dane. So you're actually going to be in the... I don't know, maybe. You know... Probably you can, yeah. Well, it depends what his odds are. If he's too short, then I won't put money on it. Well, his odds are horrible, so I wouldn't put him to work. Oh, I probably would box him. And who is that? Oh, I don't know. I think there's... Is there some Irish horse? Maybe, yeah. Yeah, maybe that Jukebox Jewry, yeah. So you know quite a bit about horses, do you? No, I've got no idea about horses. Yep, yep. And it's a mugs race as well. Like, real punters don't punt on the Melbourne Cup because it's too difficult, I think. Yeah, I think... Well, people who put real amounts on, like not wussy $10 bets, don't bet on the Melbourne Cup because there's too many international horses with... And I think it's hard for them to judge their form and stuff and how they're going to go. You've put some... Oh, not yet. I might, maybe. I might put something in for a, like a win in the place and then maybe box a trifecta. Do you just have a pick every year? No. No. No. Oh, I can't remember who I picked last year. Oh, fair enough. Then for dinner you said you had a roast. Yep. And you roast. Yep. No. I think she's doing photo stuff. Oh, I don't mind cooking. Like washout. Yeah. Yeah, washout. Okay. I don't know how you do that. Alright, I'm just going to wrap things up right now. You just have to answer no comment and uncooperative. Okay. Okay, so Friday night she'll go to Kate's Farewell.
