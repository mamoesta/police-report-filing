 Yes, I did. You didn't take care, did you? Alright, hit me, start the finish, go. Okay, we took a weekend trip to Los Angeles. Oh. Yep, and we caught up with some of my partner's friends. We stayed in their apartment in West Hollywood. Yeah, sorry. I'm just recalling what happened. On the first day we went to a quirky little cafe down the street and had some iced coffee. But it was a bit unusual because it wasn't milky, it was just coffee with ice in it. Later that night we went to, it was kind of like a typical American type of place. We had spare roops to eat. Typical American. Yeah, well the seats were red, kind of vinyl. It kind of reminded me of something out of like Greece, you know that kind of 50s style. Yeah, yeah, I guess so. Yep, so that was good. Then just headed home that night. The next day we went to the Getty up in the hills. We drove there and then we took a train. That night we went out for sushi and caught up with some more of their friends. And had sake and Japanese beer with our sushi. Then we went out to a nightclub and had some Blue Lagoon drinks and a fairy floss cocktail. Yeah, and then we ended up walking home from there and stopped off on like a few attractions. They have a big guitar on the way home. Is that it? Yeah, a giant guitar. Got some photos taken with that. Yeah, and then yeah, went home. And then the next day we got driven back to the airport and made our way back to Australia. Do you want anything else? The queues were quite long, so it took a lot of lining up. No, we flew with Virgin. They were quite good, better than I was expecting. Yeah, we didn't really do much at the airport. It was quite a small terminal. When we got back here, it was raining. Only got back the other day. Pouring, which was a bit of a letdown because it was nice warm weather over there. Typical sunny Canberra. Yeah. No, not too bad. We did go to Floriade for a little while. Walked around and looked at flowers. Went up on the light deck and overlooked it. Actually, we went to the Lindemann wine tent and had some cheese and wine. I had a sweet red wine, which I don't normally do. Did you get that on tape? He was saying I was immature. Yes, we got that on tape. So, you went to... Yes, yeah, we went on a super jet. So, it was very quick. So, when you normally fly, it would take about 14 hours, but the super jet's about two and a half times quicker than that. So, it was about five hours. Well, Richard Branson, is that his name? Yeah, no. Is that his name? Anyway, yeah, you know how he has a rocket ship that goes to the moon? Yes. Well, they have an in-between, an aeroplane and that, which is the super jet thing. What's money? So, you flew business. Sure. And what's that like? Yes, it was very lovely and fancy. You could lie down, sleep. You don't get all crumpled up. Really? Yeah. My partner does not work for the AFP. Yes, he was very generous. Joy. It wasn't a rocket ship. No? No. It was called a super jet. A super jet. Yeah. Right. I feel like you don't believe me. Everywhere. Okay, and then you said you got to LA and you stayed in Hollywood. West Hollywood. West Hollywood. We saw one celebrity. That was Samuel L. Jackson. What? No, we saw him. Oh, you're not a god. No, no, no. No, he was on Rodeo Drive. Yes, Rodeo Drive. No, Rodeo Drive is closer to Hollywood, but we went out to Hollywood. No, no. Not bad. And you reckon the iced coffee there is... It was different. It wasn't milky like you would expect an iced coffee to be when you purchase in Australia. Right. Yeah. All right. You said you weren't wasted, I'll do that. That wasn't the first night. That was the second night. Yep. Yeah, and I didn't say wasted. I said we had some sake and some Japanese beer and then later in the evening we had some Blue Lagoons and a fairy floss cocktail. Yes. Neither did I. Really? Yeah, it's pretty cool. So what is a fairy... No, it was kind of in like a silver dish and it had the fairy floss on top and a cocktail underneath. Right. So you literally had... That is correct, yes. Maybe. It was an enjoyable night. That was a good drink. I think it was light blue. Light blue. I don't think I said it was pink. I don't think I said it was pink. Okay, you said you saw a giant car, was it? Yes. I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the two. No, I don't. I wouldn't call it major, but yeah, it was a big guitar. Yes, it's West Hollywood. It's not, it's giant. It's bigger than a normal guitar, but it's not as big as like the big orange or the big rocking horse or the big pineapple. So how big? Yeah, probably. Probably. So how big was it? It was a big one. It was a big one. It was a big one. It was a big one. It was a big one. It was a big one. It was a big one. It was a big one. They're really good. You should try them one day. I will. I will. I'll do my job then. No, no, no, no. Not my job. The partner paid for it. Very generous. I'll be honest. Obviously it must be really because you were there. I know. How lucky is that? I've never seen that. Do you know why that is? I think because the jet plane, Superjet, sorry, is so quick to go over there. It's like going to Western Australia. You don't get jet lag going to Western Australia. Anyway, because we were there for such a short period of time, I don't think your body has time to get used to the time difference. So by the time we got back, no jet lag. But, no, I don't think so because I had a friend who also went over to America and she was there for five days. No jet lag. None. We only got back the other day. So what's today? Wednesday. I got back yesterday when it was raining. Okay. Thanks for that. I have recreation leave like everyone else. Yeah. Why not? Okay. We'll finish up. You can sit back by yourself. And it's a no comment Wednesday. No comment. Did you stay in Western Hollywood? No comment. Did you go to... No comment. No comment. No comment.
