 Okay, I got up approximately six o'clock, had a shower and got dressed and had breakfast, which was basically just cereal and fruit. I drove to work, firstly to the laboratory at Pemulway, where I did a little bit of work and sorted out my desk and moved stuff into boxes, which I then drove to my new office at Charles Street. I spent the rest of the day pretty much working at Charles Street, although I did also have a meeting out at Lidcombe with the people from Downs and I attended that for an hour or two in the morning as well. And at the end of the day, probably about four o'clock-ish, I went home and I cooked dinner, which was a fairly mediocre chicken casserole, which nobody ate, and so that is sitting in the fridge for dinner tonight as well. And after that, I just watched TV and went to bed. Yep. Shower. Not a bath, no. No, just cereal and fruit. Apple, just an apple cut up, yes. No, I drove into work, firstly to Pemulway and then to Charles Street, and then later to Lidcombe for a meeting. That's right, yes, I was packing boxes to move to my new office, yes. Boxes. No, I drove, spoke with my colleagues at Charles Street, so that would have been Dr Raymond, Dave Raper, some of the other people within the office. Probably closer to four o'clock, I believe. No, not three o'clock. No, I cooked dinner myself. Nobody had any, actually. My wife was babysitting and the only one of our children that lives at home didn't come home until quite late, so he didn't want any, so it's in the fridge for tonight. No, no, I collapsed in front of the TV after that. No, I probably went to bed about quarter to ten, I'd say. Ten approximately, yes. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment.
