 Okay, yesterday I had a massive sleep in. I woke up at 10 o'clock. What I do the rest of the day, I just potted around the house. We had leftovers for lunch. Just played with the girls, Lego and things like that. About three o'clock I took the girls to Bunnings and we just got some herbs and some little pot plants and we're going to plant those. We returned home, that was probably about four o'clock and we planted the plants in the pot. About five o'clock my parents came to pick up my girls and took them to see the Christmas lights in town. What happened after that? I went for a bike ride then, probably about 5.30. I got back about six o'clock and then I wrapped Christmas presents pretty much for the rest of the night. We had dinner about 7.30, we had Thai. What else did I do? I finished wrapping Christmas presents probably about nine o'clock and then I went to bed about 10 o'clock. I did watch television while I was wrapping the presents. I watched 60 Minutes. No, that was pretty much it. No, yep. I just went out in the park and up through Sydney Olympic Park. There's a bike track there. Yep, no, I pushed bike. Yeah, no, no. Saturday, ah, you're stretching the memory there. I stayed home in the morning. What did we do at lunchtime? I can't remember. We went out for dinner Saturday night, I remember that. We tried somewhere new and took the girls out to pizza and met another family out there which was fun.
