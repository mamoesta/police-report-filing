 Well, I got up, I got dressed, brushed my teeth. Um, you're not writing this down, are you? Oh, that's okay. Um, brushed my teeth, um, put some makeup on, did my hair, kissed my kids goodbye. Um, drove to the station, Kingswood Station, got on the train there to come to work. Um, got off at Parramatta, walked into the building. Then I came in and had a, had a cup of tea and some bagged beans on toast for breakfast. Did my work, um, and then at lunchtime I went and had lunch with my friend from upstairs. Um, we had a good gas bag and had a salad for lunch with tuna. It's very boring, but I'm on a diet. Um, and then in the afternoon, what did I do in the afternoon? Oh, then I finished, oh, I was doing phone lists for our level. So I was working on that in the afternoon and we had new people turn up. So I was introducing them to everybody. I took them upstairs, introduced them to everyone else up there. Then I can't remember, what did I do? I went home, um, caught the train home again, and then I went over a friend's house for dinner. Dinner wasn't that great. It was boring, which I like steak, but it was a bit boring. Mashed potato with veggies. We watched, um, Adam Sandler's movie, Happy Gilmore. That's a funny movie. I've seen it a thousand times, but still laugh. And then came home. My kids were at their dad's house. They were at home and had a little chat with them and had a shower and went to bed. Um, six o'clock. I had baked beans on toast, no butter and a cup of tea. Yeah, I don't have breakfast at home. I have it when I get here because I'm always rushed for time. I, oh, I think it was 10 to eight. I think I had lunch at one o'clock and that went for 40 minutes. Salad and tuna. And then leave work. I left work and I caught, um, let me think. I caught the 446 train. So I would have left here about 4.35. And you caught the train? Yep. I drove straight home first and, um, then went. I got there at 6.30, T-bone steak. No, not really. And then you watched? Yeah, we watched Happy Gilmore. I got home at 9.30 and I went to bed at about 10.15. So what did you do on Saturday? Oh, Saturday, uh, my friend, same friend picked me up and we went up the mountains. We went to Katoomba. Um, and went on the sky, sky, whatever it's called. Cape, uh, the sky, the walk, I don't know, the cable lift thing and the train. And we did the nature walks there. Um, about 5.30? You go out? No, I stay at home and watch Ratatouille. Ratatouille. I know, it's exciting. Do you remember what you had? Oh, what did I have? Um, oh, crap. Made myself dinner. I mean, oh, that's right. It was horrible stir fry I made. Chicken stir fry. No, I put too much oyster sauce in it. It was very, um. On Sunday, Sunday is normally my cleaning day. So, oh, that's right. I slept in the morning and then got up and went and did the groceries at Woolies. It was very hot on Sunday, so I was tired when I got back. So, I put the groceries away, had a lay down and then my parents turned up and that was the end of my day. Um, my dad came to do some stuff at my house. So, he did that stuff that he had to do and then they went home. Oh, and my nan was there too. Yep. So, what time did you get home? About 12 o'clock, one hour, fortunately. Okay, so you got home at about? Yeah, about that. So, yesterday morning, um, I received. Oh, that's because I was talking. Oh, um, no. I said your colleague. Oh, okay. So, I'm going to make up a story. Um, oh, that's because I was out the front talking to my friend that I haven't seen in a long time. Um, 9.30. Um, you had lunch with friends? Just one of my friends. Um, and you didn't go to? No, I didn't. I just went up and had lunch in her office. So, you didn't go out? No. So, then. About that. Yep, yeah, I left here. Okay, um, so you did information over. Oops, um, that wasn't me. That was my twin sister. Okay, do you have a twin? Yep. Are you identical? Yep. So, um, where do you. Yep. Every single day. Yep. And she tries to pose as me and says that she's me, but it's not really me. So, on Sunday, on Saturday, sorry, on Sunday when you went grocery shopping, um, you went to Woolworths? Yep. So, that was, uh, so what time did you leave Woolworths? Oh, well, I left home probably at 12 o'clock, so I must have got to Woolworths about 12.05. It's only around the corner. Yep. So, when, so you were shopping. Yeah, well, an hour from door to door. So, it would have been about 40 minutes in the store by the time I packed my car and that. So, you went to prison when? No, seven years old. Is there any damage? Yes, um, people keying my car at the station. No. So, when did you die? On the weekend. Oh, there is damage actually. There's a dent in my door, um, passenger door, back door, I think. Um, I did that because my car had been keyed and my dad was trying to get the marks out for me. On the weekend? Yep, on Sunday. On Sunday? Yep, I was trying to polish them out. So, um, we've received information that, um, for all ages in your name, a person seen driving from the Woolworths along Smiths and that it be. Oh, that's my twin sister. That's not me. Driving your car? She must have, no, she must have got a car exactly the same as mine. She must have forged it because she wants to be me. So, you don't remember any incidents? No, I wasn't involved in any incidents. You sure? Yep, I'm positive. It's my twin sister. So, you got home at about one o'clock? Yep. And you don't? No, I wasn't on Smith Street. That's a lie. You don't? No. Travelling north? No, didn't see him. I was singing and in my car, so maybe I just didn't see him. Maybe I wasn't paying attention. So, do you know whether you were afraid? No, I don't think I did. No. So, when you paraceed? No, didn't see a cyclist. No. So... I just thought there was a speed bump there. Did you check in your Revision? No, just drove my car. So, when you got home, when did your father... Oh, about two o'clock, three o'clock. He buffed out the damning. Do you already remember? No, there was just a ding in the passenger door. That was him. He wasn't... No, he didn't try to buff that out. He only buffed the key marks. He couldn't get that out. That's just there. That's still there. So, you don't know... You remember... No, no red paint. No. If there is, I didn't see it. And if he's buffed it off, well, I can't help that. So, do you think it's possible that when... Maybe. I wasn't really paying attention, so maybe. I don't really pay attention when I drive. I just drive. If they're in my way, that's their problem. We'll get back to that. Where's your vehicle? Um, it's parked over in the car park as I drove to work today. All right. Okay. What is your... No comment. What is your address? No comment.
