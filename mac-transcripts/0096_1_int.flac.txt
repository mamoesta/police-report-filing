 Um, yesterday I got up and um, went to the toilet and ironed my clothes. I put on the telly to watch the morning news. And I made my lunch and had my breakfast. And then said goodbye to my husband who's dying of man flu. And then popped out, oh no, missed the bus, sat back down, had a cup of tea, popped outside for the bus. And what did I do? Did I catch the bus or the train? I caught the bus, got off station, caught the train, went to the coffee shop, assumed my alias at the coffee shop and ordered a blackfee. And then I took my coffee back to work and unfortunately had to attend the morning, Monday morning meeting which is very boring. And then went to, did that, talked to my staff, got into work. I have a very boring day actually. What else did I do? Spoke to the aliens and, do I have to go through my whole day? Is that all we're going to talk about? Alright, better make it interesting. Okay, so then um, usual time about 12 o'clock. And my buddy, she wasn't here because she, we went out the night before and she was too tired so she took a flexi day, like a junk. And I went and had, I know I was good and I made my own lunch so I just had that at about 12. I was very tired, that's why I can't remember what I did. Had lunch, then left work at 3 o'clock and took the bus home all the way. And got home and played with my cat and talked to my cat and then ate some dinner, watched a movie, attended to my husband who was still dying of even worse man flu and um, went to bed.
