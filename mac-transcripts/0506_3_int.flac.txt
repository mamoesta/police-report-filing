 I stopped thinking. I'm like, now I gotta try and think of something. So I go like... No, but there's two M's. It was M-M. Monkey Magic! You could have thrown us a lifeline. You've been told, Jen. So much crap. Yeah? You just look at her and laugh. Oh, story time, come on. Story time. Not much. Yeah. Talk about the same old, same old. Oh, I went home, had a few beers, went to Bunnings. Oh, I'll talk about something. Righto, so, woke up, no, woke up the other morning and was with a bunch of mates. We decided to go down the river for a swim. Swam for approximately half an hour. Jumped off a few tree branches. Nobody checked the depth of the water before we did that, so it was pretty stupid, but you know. Anyway, as I said, we swam for about half an hour. Then we decided to go to McDonald's to get some breakfast. Got some breakfast from McDonald's. Went back to the place that we were staying at. Someone thought it'd be a good idea to do a vinnies run before going to the races. So everyone... Nope. So it's nothing. So everyone jumped into the bus wearing a pair of shorts, a pair of football shorts. And then did a mad dash down to the Opportunity Shop where people bought their outfit for the races. From there, from there, a few of the blokes, you know, going to the races and all, thought it'd be pretty funny to get kitted out in skirts and accessorise with handbags and hats and bits and pieces. And some other of my mates cruised and just got suits, standard race attire. From there, we drove the car slash bus to a mate's old man's pub, had a few beers and then wandered over to the races where we had a marquee set up. Had a marquee set up, free alcohol, so had a bit to drink. And then one of the guys thought it'd be real funny to try and get on Fashion to the Field, being dressed up in a skirt and accessorised with bits and pieces. So tried to get into that. We shattered when they turned him away. But the amount of people that were looking and laughing at him was hilarious, which is always good. Then after the races, pretty much only bet on the first three races because it blew all my money. And then went back to mate's old man's pub, had a few more drinks and then won $500 on the poker machines. And then went down, no, we stayed there. We stayed there and they had a bit of a nightclub slash disco slash DJ playing. Partied away, got my groove on and then that was about it. Not that I can remember that night. So bloke's day out, that's about it. Yeah, it would have been about 6.30, 6.37. Yeah, just walked to the river. It was only, it was less than a cove, it was only probably about 500 metres. Yep. No, no one got hurt. Oh, I said that we didn't check the depth of the water before jumping off the trees. Yep. No, it wasn't too bad. It wasn't too deep, but it wasn't deep. They had lots of fun. No, it was just climb the tree, jump off the branches. 10 metres. Yep. Oh, if we climbed to the top, probably would have been about 45 metres. Yep. No. Yep. That's correct. Yes. Yes. It was just a real dodgy tan coloured suit. It looked like it was fresh out of the 70s. Fit was, yeah, real dodgy. No. No. About 15 bucks. No. No. Just had to wear thongs. No, that's, no coloured shirt, just a suit. I got some, got some pants. Got some pants. Short jeans. No, I just walked straight through. No, I wasn't driving. It was a minivan, 13 seater. I'm not sure. I wasn't the one filling it up. No idea. No idea. Carting 13 bikes around, nasty. Oh, just had a few beers at mate's old man's pub. Yep. Yep. Oh, little girls at the races, but yep. No, he missed out. Shattered. No, he was shattered. He didn't get on. Turned away. Yep. Nope. The ones with the funny names. Can't remember. No. I can't remember. Would have remembered that, but no. Not too much. No. No chance. No. 1200, that's it. Yeah. Just had no money to bet on the horses. It was well budgeted. No, this is just a little bit of common sense. Ah, $5 bet. Feature, feature, and got the feature again. No, it was just $5, so 10, 20 bets per line. 25 lines. Yep. Yep. Yep. Five of a kind. Five of a kind. Yep. Disco, dancing. Just a bit of dance music. Pretty late night. Yeah, not coming. Not coming. Not coming. Not coming. Not coming.
