 I've just moved house so I got up in the morning, tried to find everywhere to find my toothbrush and all my toiletries which is a real pain and all my clothes and everything all over the place so I had a shower, really quick shower, running late to work. I drive into work from home, park my car. When I got to work I had some breakfast, I just had some muffins with Vegemite and butter. I was doing some admin work yesterday so I was just sorting through some files and updating some information on the computer. I had a chat a lot to some of my colleagues, quite a lot throughout the day, some things about work, some things personal, chit chat about the weekend. I went out and got some lunch and had an egg and salad sandwich for lunch. I felt really sick. I don't think it was from that though so I went home early. Had a nap for about an hour when I got home. Had an open inspection on the house we're moving out of for new tenants so I wasn't feeling too well. I got my sister-in-law to go around and open up the house and let everybody through. I spent the rest of the night pretty much just resting up, watching a little bit of TV, having a little look on Facebook, chat to my mother-in-law. That probably sums it up I guess. About between 10.30 and 11. I just had avocado on toast because I wasn't feeling too good and had some juice as well. What's that show called? Celebrity Apprentice. Just got a little bit of that. Pardon? Celebrity Apprentice. Yeah, yeah and then watch a little bit. So what time did you end up leaving yesterday? Quarter to three I think. And what time did you have lunch? About one o'clock. And when did you get up? Probably about 10 to seven. Left by 7.30. So if you leave at 7.30. Well yesterday got me in late, got me in about 10 past eight. Normally I'd have to leave about 10 to 15 minutes earlier than that. So you started? Yeah. So when you drive to work, do you ever get... No. I used to. Sometimes I used to but I got a little bit lazy. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
