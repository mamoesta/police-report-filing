 Yesterday being a Sunday I had a sleep in, so I actually didn't get up until I woke up about 8.30, but laid in bed till about 9.00. Got up with the intention of cleaning the house, and I didn't quite get there. But just hung around home, went out and did the groceries, came back, had some lunch and then just had a lazy afternoon at home because the weather was so cold. Cooked some dinner, watched some telly and then went to bed. It's a very non-eventful day yesterday. 10.30, pancakes, which is terrible. But it was Sunday and there was a shaker thing in there and I couldn't be bothered cooking anything else. Yes, we had a big lunch, so just at home. I had just a wrap with roast beef and salad, toasted in the toaster. No, it was just like from the deli. Yeah, so rolled it up like you do a kebab in Lebanese bread and toasted it. It was nice. Bit of hummus, some sauce. 11.30 there about. I was back by 1.30. The traffic was terrible. I think being Christmas shopping, cold. Yes, by myself. Saturday, I got up, I went to the shops. I had to buy a few things because we're going to a barbecue that afternoon. So I had to get salad ingredients, came back, prepared the salads, had a shower, drove up to the Central Coast for the barbecue and stayed there until about 9.30, 10 o'clock and then drove home. Home by 11. Yes, I had a shower and then went to bed. Yeah, party. Christmas barbecue, about 4.30. I had soda water and one champagne. I was the designated driver for the night. About between 3 and 3.30. I can't remember exactly. Yeah, well, our car, a ute. No, Jason's. Yes. Oh, occasionally my sister-in-law might borrow it if I've got her kids and I'll just take her car with the car seat out of ease. But generally it's just him and I. No, no. Jason drove up and I drove back. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, yeah. No, I didn't see them, but I did doze off on the way up. Had a little bit of a nap. No, that's not true. About 3.45, we still would have been on the Pacific Highway in traffic. So it must be another car. They saw. I would probably say not till around 4, just after 4. He hasn't mentioned and I don't know anything about that. Well, I could have been. I was asleep at some point on the F3. I don't know where exactly. No, but I don't remember seeing any cyclists. Never. No, no, not at all. Oh, no, that's not right. About 9.30. Yeah, 9, 9.30. It was Coles, I think I said. Mm, very rarely. Sometimes, they're just down the road from home. Sometimes. The local supermarket would probably be just the IGA. There's a little mini mart on the corner, but I don't go there very often. Yeah, like it's got, you know, milk and bread and a few packets of biscuits. But that would be all. Yeah, generally, I think. Roast beef. Yeah. Yeah, I do, actually. Yeah, I do like the rare roast beef. It's nice. Um, no, just in the afternoon. Actually, I think last time we were here, we talked about True Blood. We finished the season of True Blood yesterday afternoon. Had a quiet afternoon. No, I have not heard of it. OK, yeah, no, I haven't seen it. Pancakes, yep. Hot cakes. I think so. I think they just call them hot cakes in America. Yeah. Oh, I don't know. They could be. Uh, 10, 10.30. No, I went to Kohl's on Saturday. Same as yesterday. Sure. No comment. No comment. No comment.
