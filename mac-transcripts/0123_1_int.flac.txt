 I got up and had some breakfast and made the lawn, did the edges, got the leaves off the roof, out of the gutters, then I swept up all the leaves and the grass, put them in a garbage bin, had some lunch and then after lunch I had a nap and then I, what did I do after that, played with the dogs for a bit, took one of the dogs for a walk and came home, started cleaning inside the house and made some dinner and I was asleep by about eight o'clock. I did, I went to bed at eight. Did you watch it? Did I? Actually I watched the Women's Weekly Christmas Special. I think it was on channel nine. No, not really. It wasn't, no, it wasn't really very good. No, it had all the C rated celebrities in it. Yeah, and it wasn't, no, it wasn't really that good. Not a very good show, no. What did I have for dinner? I had chicken Caesar salad. No, well I bought the chicken and some of the salad. Yeah, I prepared it at home, yeah. And your dog? I took my dog for a walk around the block, which is actually quite large, it's probably two kilometer round trip. Was it raining? When I took the dog for a walk it wasn't raining, but on our entry back, not coming back into the house, it poured down, yeah. I just got back in time, yeah. Actually I was a little bit wet, but that's all right, tiny bit. So how long the walk? The walk would have been about 40 minutes. Oh gosh, probably, probably. I paid no attention whatsoever. It's just in my own world. Yeah. Did you let your dog leave? No, no, no. Yes. Is he? Yeah, German Shepherd. Oh, okay. Yeah. So what time was your dog? I'd say that that was probably about one. So what time did he leave? Probably about 11.30. I would say maybe half an hour, 45 minutes or so. Yeah, just on the lounge nap, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure, a power nap, yeah. And so when you were taking your dog to go for a walk? No, no. So when you were walking, do you remember passing him? No, no. Okay, well we received a report, someone mentioned, yeah, as they walk past your dog, the dog, your dog. Oh, okay. Um, no, that's not true. My dog wears a muzzle. Oh, does he? Yeah. Well, yeah. Has he bitten something? No. So a German Shepherd? Um, sometimes if you train them that way. Mine's, mine's actually an ex-guard dog. He? Yeah, good. Yeah, because he's, he knows he's the boss. Yeah. So, um, because he had his muzzle, you ran out the door? Yeah, no, no. Okay, so, um, got up yesterday at about six? Yeah, probably, probably, yeah. What'd you have for breakfast? Wheat bigs? No. Did you eat Vegemite? Yeah, no, no, no, no, I had Promite when I was like little, yeah. Have you ever eaten sweetened? Yeah, I don't know, I don't, I know I didn't like it, I'll just stick with Vegemite. And what about Marmite? I don't know about Marmite, I don't know if I've ever tried Marmite. Um, no. Yes, I do. Do you do that one? Yes, I do. And, um, do you have porridge in winter? Yes, I do. No, I use the free-pouring Uncle Tabby's. It's in a box and you can just free pour as much as you want, yeah. And then just take it out? I do. Do you ever boil water? No, I use the microwave. Um, do you use milk? Just milk, no water. Water, yeah, I know, no, I don't like that. So then you went out and you trimmed the, um, the, the edges? The edges of the, you know, the lawn edges and the path edges. Oh, so you did trim those? Not hedges, edges, just on the pathway, you know, like with a whipper snipper. Do you have a hedge? Yeah, no. And then, um, you also cleaned out the back? Yep, um, I did one side. No, the other side's too high, I can't reach it. Yeah, in the front, front, I've done the front. Do you have a front porch? Yep. So, um, then you had? Last night? Oh, say about seven.

No. We've received information that a man has walked the dog? Right, I say that's almost impossible to get out of my backyard, almost, because I have a, um, 10-foot, um, fence around the back and a, so from the backyard down both sides, the, um, the fence is about 10-foot from the back and it goes to about 8-foot down towards the front and the dog doesn't jump.
