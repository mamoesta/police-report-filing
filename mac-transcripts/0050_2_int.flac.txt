 I woke up in the morning and what did I do? I think I had breakfast but I can't remember what I had and then um what did I do? I can't even remember. I got my suns up and I think I swandered around the house for a little while and then we waited for the rain to stop. We went down the back, cleared the yard from all the leaves and flowers that fall from the neighbor's trees and then proceeded to try and paint and my niece came over and helped. She looked after the two youngest kids, the oldest one went to preschool and yeah after lunch we painted and then it rained and we stopped painting and then the rain stopped and we started painting again and that went on and off all afternoon until I had enough of the rain. So I went inside, had a cup of tea and waited for dinner time, couldn't be bothered cooking. Went and got some Chinese food. My niece stayed so we had takeaway because she'd been painting and we thought that's better than just having meat and vegetables for dinner and she left, put the kids in bed and then went to bed at about 10 o'clock. She left about eight o'clock after we watched Fireman Sam. Yes we did. Man vs. Wild. Wild. Bear Grylls. It's a very good episode too. I did. I do. Every now and then. No. No that was yesterday.
