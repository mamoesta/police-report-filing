 The weekend? It was Wednesday. That was only five days ago. Three days ago. Yeah. That was about six months ago I reckon. No, weekend. Let's see what happened on the weekend. Um. I can't even do that. Um. Let's see what went out. No, had dinner. Had people around for dinner on Saturday night. Um. Cooked a quiche. Pretty nice. Not really, no. Bit of a quiet one. Last time I had a holiday? Yeah, yeah. Had a day skiing. It wasn't really a holiday but I had a day skiing. That was about September. Yeah, I could try and do that. Actually, interestingly, I did that. Went for a day skiing. But you know I was rung up by one of those telemarketing people who did a survey and they wanted to ask about my travel in the last few months. And they were interested in people who'd stayed overnight somewhere and travelled around the country. So I, yeah, but sometimes I answer them so I did that anyway. And, day of the skiing day. The skiing day. Alright. Alright, so. Uh. Skiing day. I woke up early in the morning. So decided the night before to go skiing. Uh. So, woke up at about 5 o'clock when it was certainly still dark. Uh. Jumped in the car. Didn't have to fill it up with fuel because I'd already done that the night before. And, uh. Started driving down to the snow. It's about two and a half hours drive down there. And the sun starts to rise just before you get into Cooma. Stopped in Cooma at a bakery. Had a cup of coffee and a muffin for breakfast. Uh. And then continued on into Jindabyne. Um. Again stopping for a cup of coffee there. There's a little French bakery there. Does good cups of coffee. Then drove up to the snow. Went to, got on the first lift queue by about quarter to nine. So that's pretty good timing. Um. Crowds were pretty good. Snow was pretty good. Skied, uh. Where did we go? Went up to the Mount Blue Cow area. Um. Did a few runs around there. And then I went off to, uh. The area called Guthaga. So that's a bit of a traverse from Mount Blue Cow. You've got to work across there a bit. Uh. Went there. Skied there until the crowds turned up just before lunchtime. Uh. And then went back into the Blue Cow area and did a couple more runs there. Um. Had some really nice runs down, um. The summit, from the summit of Mount Blue Cow. Down a run they call the ridge. Um. And what did we do after that? After that, actually stopped and had something to eat. At the, there was a little hut down there. Down the bottom one of the chairlifts there. They've got little disco lights and they play music. Um. Yeah. So it's a nice little vibe to go and stop and have your hot dog and a cup of coffee. Uh. Then went back across the resort to, uh. Mount Perisher area and had a look at the snow there. It wasn't too bad. But it's past its best because in that time of day, snow starts to melt. Especially in springtime. And it's as good as the morning. And then called it quits by about 3.30. And started heading back down the mountain. Um. Uh. And then drove home. Actually made it home back to Canberra by about, uh. 6 o'clock maybe. And then went out for drinks after that. So that was a pretty long day. So. Sure. Uh. Well it was birthday drinks for a couple of guys here. Yeah. I forgot about that so long ago. Um. It was at the Kremlin Bar. Which isn't a bad place. Um. Good crowd of people. Mostly from, from work here. They were there. Um. And it was for birthday drinks for a guy here. And his new wife. They'd just been married about a month earlier than that. And it was his birthday. And they were about to head off on their honeymoon. So it was a bit of a multiple celebration. Um. Kicked on there till about 9.30 I think. Which for, you know, waking up at 5am and skiing all day. And getting back for drinks and doing that. With a bit of sunburn on your face. Wasn't a bad, wasn't a bad night. Yeah. It happens. But normally after a skiing day. After a skiing day you're absolutely knackered by the, you know. By 7, 8, 8 o'clock. You just want to fall in a bit. Yeah. I've done that before and I've crashed a car at the end of, you know. Yeah. I've done that. That was bad news. That was two days without sleep. And then midnight on the last night just ran to the back of a taxi. It was parked on the side of the road too. So. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. About September I think. Yeah. Oh. I thought about it for a couple of days beforehand. But yeah. Basically don't decide till the day before. Down. Yeah. You can do that down here. Ah. Not this year. But yeah. Normally. Normally I'd go pretty regularly. Yeah. No. This year I've been skiing once. It's not the only time I've been skiing. That's right. Usually. Yeah. Yeah. Although I try to mix it up a little bit. I'm two skis I suppose like everyone else. Ah. Yeah. I got the gear. Got the clothing. Pants. Ski boots. Socks. Not for one day. No. No. I didn't stay. Well. I didn't stay down there. So. That's it. Yep. No. I tried that once. But it didn't do it for me. I tried it to see what I was missing out on. But not much by the sounds of it. Oh. It looks like a lot of fun. But I already have a lot of fun on skis. And the effort required to actually start snowboarding and become good at it. I did it for a day and went you know what. I've got the patience. Yeah. Yeah. I did that. Yeah. But you know what. The difference is your feet are strapped in on the snowboard. You can't get them out. The thing I didn't like about the snowboard was when you're sitting on the chairlift. You want to. You know. As a skier you can sit back and relax. But as a snowboarder you're sitting in this weird ass position. Where your feet and your back are twisted around. You're just never at rest. You're never comfortable. And even when you're stopping on the side of the hill. If you just want to stop and admire the view. Unless you unbolt your feet and actually take your feet out of the snowboard. You're not resting. Your muscles are always working to actually stop you on the side of the hill. But you know. Some people love it though. So you know. You're one or the other. No. Skiers go much faster than snowboarders. Yeah. I reckon. Oh. Pipes are a different thing. You don't get speed on pipes. You just. You do. That's for skills. Oh. I'm not really good at getting the air and things like that. So no. I can go fast and I can turn fast. But I can't. That's a mugs game. That's for death wishing. And well it's not even us. It's not even us. Is she a local? Is she an import like the Canadian guy? So I asked him Australia won a gold medal. It was Dale Beaksmith who was a Canadian. He'd never spent five minutes here. Born and bred in Canada. But he signed up to ski for Australia. Yeah. That's right. What sort of skating? I've been ice skating for years. Did it when I was a kid. Yeah. Nah. Nothing like that. I'm actually pretty bad at ice skating. Yeah. Funnily enough. I can skate but it's much harder than skiing. Nah. Nah. My little nooses can. They're brilliant at it. They do figure skating teams and competitions and that sort of thing. But nah. I don't know. Maybe some people think that. Oh yeah. Yeah. There's a little hut down the bottom of a chairlift there. Yeah. That's pretty good. A guy there that does. It's just a hut in the middle of the snow. So on a sunny day it's pretty nice. Nah. Nah. Nah. They just play the music through CDs. Yeah. Don't think a band would enjoy that very much. Yeah. It starts to melt by then. That's right. Yeah. It does. Yeah. Yeah. It gets pretty heavy and sloshy. It slows you down for a start. And it also means you're working different muscles because the snow's a lot heavier. So you've got to change the way you ski so that the turns aren't as nice as they would be if you had good quality snow. A little bit. Yeah. It can be. Yeah. It's not too bad. The other thing is that in the morning, because it gets cold, it still gets really cold overnight, so the cold temperature freezes the wet slushy snow. So in the morning it's hard packed a bit like ice. But then by the afternoon when it gets warmer it turns into a bit of a 7-11 slushy again. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes you can hear the crunching under your skis and the backs of your skis get nicely scratched up and things. Yep. Nat Comment!
