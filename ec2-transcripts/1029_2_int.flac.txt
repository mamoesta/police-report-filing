 um oh right okay on saturday we tried to get up reasonably early because uh we had to get rid of all our cutlery in the kitchen i mean not cutlery crockery um all the plates and bowls and all that crap um we had to sort it all out and it we got we were doing this from about 10 30 till about 1 30 going through all the pots and pans and working out what we actually need in our kitchen and boxing up the stuff that wasn't ours and um and then uh after all that uh we had lunch at hot dogs about 1 30 and then i had to go and buy some new plates so that we could have dinner that night um so i drove out to paramatta along the m4 um took a while to find a park actually but uh ended up in in myer and bought three sets of plates um it was pretty easy really and we went to uh one of the other homeware stores i forget the name but we bought some little bowls to help with cooking to put things in and then we we came home and we were just thinking we'll sit down and you know watch the basketball off the internet and um and my housemate came in and and he'd been napping all day while we were shopping and walking around and stuff and he started trying to clean up some mess that i'd left somewhere and we're just like leave it but he kept trying to clean it up so we had to stop and get up and clean it up so that he was happy and then then we watched the basketball um then a little bit later we had dinner but i completely forget what it was um no idea i can't even remember what i have no it was it was that we cooked something but i no i have no idea what i have for dinner on saturday night that's really sad well god that's really weird um no just it would have had to have been oh we had a salad because there was salad left over in the fridge on sunday um possibly salad and sausages or something like that but it's still not ringing a bell it's so weird yeah yeah it was good very pleased oh i think we watched a movie this was sunday night um we watched 50 50 it's a movie about cancer a comedy about cancer i guess yeah i guess so yeah um about 10 o'clock no no yep no um well i wasn't sure at first we had to box all this stuff up because this girl was going to come and pick it up our ex-housemates cousin uh we weren't we thought she was coming at 9 30 on saturday morning but then she changed it to sunday afternoon thank god um yeah we just wanted to get it out of the way and clear some space out so i could fit things in there probably 9 30 oh i don't know i was up i think i was awake earlier than that but i don't remember anymore no i don't usually watch well no there's nothing to watch at the moment yeah um this girl from south africa aric's housemate she just didn't even call us she just told her cousin hey yeah you can take my stuff and even though we're using it and so this random girl we didn't even know if she was her cousin or not called us and we're sort of thinking uh you know who are you uh you know does you know i mean she knew the right names and everything but and of course it was the cousin but would have been nice for a heads up saying by the way i'd like you to give my things to my cousin we did actually yeah it was actually pretty funny we we sent this girl an email and she didn't reply so we ended up telling the cousin that we weren't going to give her any of the stuff until we'd heard from the girl in south africa and she's just like oh suddenly we get this really long email with an invitation to a wedding in april next year and blah blah okay great uh would have been um wednesday to friday last week oh hot dogs yep no it's hot dog no i did i didn't though i remember i had to make there was seven and we had three people so one two people got half a hot dog each extra and i made it for some reason yeah oh you don't really make hot dogs from scratch but yeah boiled no we had it all there yeah yeah we're freezing we go through about one set of hot dog buns a week it's like a really dodgy lunch it did actually um it kind of tricked us up to liverpool road it wasn't too bad and then between liverpool and um oh no no not liverpool between city west link it just got much worse like five dock area to the to the start of the m4 it was pretty horrible but like it didn't take that long in the end to get out there uh along perimeter road and then turn onto m4 nah for god yeah probably um it was a bit but it was moving so yeah it was all right oh my god i my brother had an accident there actually because of the missing toll booths because he thought there was a toll and he knew he didn't have a uh an e-pass and he was in the e-pass lane he tried to merge out and crashed into someone or something i wasn't there at the time no not really um we had to go up and around and it was lucky actually we ended up being quite close to the mire entrance but it was took a while to find home home something i don't know if it was it had home in it that was bad i think it's a chain yeah um some sort of rice bowl things but we use them for cooking put stuff in yeah yeah um three all uh there's 12 places yeah and bowls and yeah yeah yeah yeah it's good special yeah okay no comment no comment no
