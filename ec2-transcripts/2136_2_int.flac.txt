 lawyers much no I don't didn't sign any waiver to say anything true um well yesterday morning I woke up at about seven o'clock had breakfast then watched the morning news find out what was happening in the world while I was asleep then I had a chat with my wife and we decided we were going to go shopping so she said she went outside oh we cleaned up breakfast things she went outside did a quick shopping list and things like that well I watched the rest of the news on TV and then we headed off to the shops down to the local shopping center we just went into Woolies and went around picking up a few things that we'd need for the week that was about it we came out we stopped at Donut King and we had she had a cup of coffee and I had a milkshake and after that we headed back to the car put the bags into the car and headed home we she went down and did some work in the garden and let the chase the dog around for a while I set up on the computer and went through some of the emails for the day we had lunch around about 12 o'clock and she sort of went and had a lay down and asleep and I sort of worked on the computer for a while that three o'clock she got up again I was still on the computer she watched a bit of TV about six o'clock we had dinner watched a bit more TV and then probably went to bed around about 11 o'clock yes just a day or now the last of my days off to know that's just a time you know well I was contemplating not getting out of bed at all but you know decided that my wife had got out before me so and I would get out and join her breakfast is just toast and a hot drink no I don't drink coffee or tea I only have hot chocolates oh no just more budget talk and things like that politicians don't interest me and a lot of politics doesn't interest me too much at all you know people arguing I can't see the sense in it that we're paying for him to argue I actually watched Fox Foxtel news yes Sky News on Foxtel oh yeah that you know it's just straight news and things like that it you know it wasn't all the other things they have yes you know something that we don't really want to talk about it and things like that I'm not really fussed about Angelina Jolie anymore you know they're just the their news programs on the on the free-to-air channels just keep seeing to be the same things over and over again and yeah I just like to listen just to the straight news or did yesterday yeah I think we would have left home possibly around about nine o'clock oh it's only about five five minutes or so we live fairly close to the shopping center oh we had a quick look around and things like that but there wasn't anything exciting and it's only a small shopping center so it was fairly quick and then just had a look around to see if there was anything we didn't really need anything other than groceries so it was just a matter of just heading there after we'd had a look around no didn't buy anything beforehand didn't really need anything it's you know no no one's birthday and no special occasions I think was right oh always take a trolley because it's easy to lean on you can't lean on a basket net never fall no I think yeah we had doughnuts they come with my wife's coffee so we had one each yeah no we sat down and ate it there you know it's nice the chairs are outside so you can sit down and comfort and have a chat you know ah yep we head straight home oh possibly about an hour yeah it seemed to be that it was I hadn't checked them on Tuesday so yeah I had about nine or so you know most of them just follow up stuff than I was looking at before no no my wife made lunch oh we just had sandwiches just had ham sandwiches with a bit of mustard on yeah I know I sit there and play games there's just a site that I go to and I just all different games that I play try to keep my mind active and that yeah and you have to use your mind to sort of work out puzzles and things like that and that's you know if I've got to sit around I'd rather not watch TV all the time and there wasn't any sport or anything that sort of interest me at the time oh I can sit there for long long times I sort of lose track after a time because you sort of go from one to another and you know you do them for a while and you sort of don't notice the time that sort of disappears when you're on the computer so I may have been there for two or two maybe three hours no no no no she'd got up and was watching shows on TV that she wished to watch and that they're not something that I'm interested in so the computers and easy and easy sort of switch off I can sort of stay there for a while things like that but what do we have last night we just had sausages and eggs we cooked up some potato gems so we just had them on the side and things like that no we watched the news and then we switched it over to one of the Foxtel channels and I think I watched a couple of shows on there that I like I think was one of them was modern restoration and I think the other one was Aussie pickers yeah no I think some of the prices that they sort of give it you know I don't think they're worth it yeah that's right yeah that's right Australia is not an old country and things like that but they did pick up a golden fleece petrol Bowser emblem and it was in cast iron and things like that and but to pay $400 for it only worth about 650 it's not a big overlay but it is a it is a profit for them but you know I'd like to be picking something for if I was a picker I'd like to be able to pick something for $50 and sell it for you know $600 yep yeah
