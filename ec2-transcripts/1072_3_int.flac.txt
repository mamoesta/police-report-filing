 Friday, um, I can't remember when I actually, actually yeah, on Friday morning I went to the gym because I didn't really go to the gym like the last few days because I was so hectic that week because I had so many assignments and tests and I remember on Thursday the test was actually really hard and that subject I'm not really doing that well in so I like, and having the test that was so hard I just felt really devo afterwards so I'm like fine I'll get good enough sleep on Thursday night and then I'll probably go to the gym and I did and I was just pushing weights and stuff because like I was just trying to release my anger and after that I felt really good because I just kind of got it out of my system um and then I went to uni for my one o'clock to three o'clock lecture and that was good because I actually finished really early um it only went for an hour but that meant like I only went to uni for an hour lecture which was really annoying but um I had CSE reviewed that night as well anyway um before I went to CSE review my friends arranged kind of like a dinner thing before um the review and we went to this place called Pinocchio Sushi um I'd never been there before but apparently uh I actually walked past it every day and I did know it was there um it's just across from Macca's and yeah it's kind of a fusion of Japanese Korean food and I ordered this I can't remember it's like this bib something it's like something Korean and it was actually really nice I liked it had like it was vegetables with rice and then chicken on top um after that we went we headed to CSE review and the line it was actually really good like it was I thought it was going to be like big line and going to be really hectic because it's usually hectic on Fridays the reviews but it was good it was like easily to get in and I sat near the door um on the bottom level which I've never done before because I've always sat on top um so that was a new view um but I still prefer probably the top because you get like an overview of the whole stage and stuff and you get to look down on people but um so I stayed until intermission but I actually really I wish I stayed longer because I actually really liked the show especially the um Mario rap part that was really really well done I thought I really liked especially the white guy rapping Mario I felt he was like he's some white kind of overweight guy but he was so good at rapping I felt like he was some like a black kid at heart um after that after intermission um my friends wanted to go out to the city so we did and I ended up seeing Andy which was really cool and I met his boyfriend um he's nice and then uh it was a good night I stayed out till 5am which I've never done before I kind of regret though because I was so freaking tired the next day um so I crashed at a friend's house who lived um in who lives in Surrey Hills which was really easy to get to and really lucky um and then so I stayed at his house but I didn't get a good night's sleep because he snored so bad um and then after that um so I couldn't since I didn't get a good night's sleep I decided just to go home um I left his house I think it was at 7am or 8am um and then I went when I got home my dad was kind of angry at me because I couldn't I tried calling him but he didn't pick up so he didn't know where I was so I felt kind of bad but it was his fault because he left his phone off um and then after that got like two hours sleep because I really needed I felt really dead um then after that I went straight to work and work was a hassle because it was so freaking busy um I was working at the back and it was just pretty much cheeseburger cheeseburger Big Mac oh serious Angus burger then cheeseburger cheeseburger pretty much followed that order and I swear my brain was dying just because it's just so monotonous and so much repetition I felt like oh how am I going to survive this and I did for five hours and but when I left work I was so dead and I just wanted to sleep but my friend said oh we should go out again because it's a long weekend and I did not want didn't want to but he kind of forced me to I'm like fine so we just went like we it was only going to be a quiet night though but we went to a friend's house I think in double bay um I didn't really yeah I felt kind of bad because I didn't talk much but I was just like I'm not in the mood to talk to anyone so I just sat there which was really bad they probably thought I was like some weirdo because I didn't talk at all but I didn't care I was just so tired um and then after that I just went home straight away and jumped on my bed because I was so freaking tired um then the next day I think yes on Sunday um I really wanted to spend kind of the day with my brother so we did um what did we do we went I think we went out somewhere we went out to the city and just hung out and stuff which we haven't done literally a year because I just don't see him that much and we just like over the last few years we haven't been that close because we've just been drifting apart and he doesn't live at home anymore but it was really good just to see him again just to hang out and be good friends again because early in the week we weren't we were having like arguments and stuff and now that's kind of sorted we've dealt with that and so now he's um we're in good terms now um and then on Monday he needed a book from uni so I drove him all the way to university found that book um actually lost my laptop on the along the way like I lost it for half an hour and then I found it I placed it um level one when I was looking at the book which was so lucky because I lost my laptop for and my parents kind of went crazy at me for doing that um so we just studied at university pretty much the whole day um and then like I was just showing him around campus showed him um the food courts um the lecture rooms and he really liked the university even though it's like it's so much bigger than Wollongong campus and just especially going um uphill he did not like that and I'm like that's what I'm used to every day you need to get used to that how do you expect or why do you expect my class is so large um and then after that we went home and then he told us he was going to go home um like just off like after an hour we got home and so like um we were all helping him pack and stuff to go home and after he left I kind of kind of hit me like oh he's gone again kind of I felt like I like I really missed him because we actually got close this weekend which we haven't done in a while um and then I couldn't really do work after that because I was just not in the mood so I kind of watched x factor and after x factor I kind of watched I went just went to the gym again just to um run and do some weights but um because my friend I really actually wanted to watch x factor anyway because my friend is in um one of the groups he's in the collective and he's doing really well so I wanted to support him I haven't seen him in a while as well um it'll be good to catch up with him now that he's famous but yeah he's he's he's always been so talented and you could just tell that he was going to go somewhere because he's such a good singer and he can play instruments and he's just a really um all-around good guy so hopefully he goes far whatever he does um we went to primary school um together and we were like really really good friends um until he moved schools but I've still stayed in contact with him but it's just we're kind of more like mutual acquaintances now rather than actually really good friends because like um him myself and another friend who actually goes to university this one um we were like the threesome like we would always hang out together and stuff and it's just now it's so funny how things change when you're little now but like still good friends I'm just I'm just happy that he's doing really well because he's always wanted to be a singer um he actually tried out for x factor last year but didn't do that well and I felt kind of sorry because he was he's a bank teller he was a bank teller for a year after that and now that he's kind of re-entered the competition and doing so well I'm so happy for him um yeah all the best for him and stuff I'm sure he's gonna be famous because he's he can he can rap he can sing he can play instruments he can do pretty much everything and he's got lots of connections now which is good so I'm sure he's gonna go far and even if he doesn't win the competition he's gonna have he's ready to establish himself as in as a part of that group and they're gonna do well anyway so um I'm happy for him No Commentå¥—
