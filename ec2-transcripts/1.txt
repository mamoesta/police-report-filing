 Ah, okay. So, Saturday, my cousin's 21st. Went to a barbecue and, I really can't remember. Oh, we were doing the deck, the pergola. So we were building a pergola, or my husband was with his dad and I was pretending to help. I was supervising and I don't remember. That's all I can remember. Maybe last week? Yep. This year? Yep. Although I did nothing. We just built the pergola again, did a lot of painting of the wood and saw a movie, went and saw The Hunger Games, lived up to the hype a bit and also all I can remember. What else did I do? I'll try and think back to Easter weekend as well. I think the whole point is just keep talking, isn't it? Yeah, for a few minutes. Um, I don't know. I really can't remember what I did. Do you remember what time you got up on Saturday? No, let's say eight o'clock. Drive anywhere in the morning? I don't think so. I think nope. Possibly toast. A terrible, terrible memory. Okay, well this weekend, Friday night, I possibly had takeaway for dinner and breakfast would have been, I think it was honey, toast with honey. And I really can't remember. Did you leave the house during the weekend? I did. Went grocery shopping at Super Barn and I was going by myself and I decided to go the separate way because I had to pick up two cases of beer to help. Toby's dad helped with the deck, so I thought I'd go and get him a case of beer as well and I decided that I found out that the opposite way that we usually go to shopping is a better way. Heavy things at the bottom and the fruit and stuff doesn't get squished because that's the last place you go. The best way to go. Do you remember what brand of beer you bought? Yeah, Corona and Carlton Dry for Toby. Do you recall the name of the attendant who bought? No, he was a young fella but... Park? Uh, three car spots away from the trolley thing. Remember the vehicles? Uh, not really. I think I parked next to a blue, possibly a Festiva, a little car anyway and everyone had gone by the time I came out. What time of the day was it? Mid, uh, mid morning, I think it was before, might have been before lunch, probably 11 o'clock. Yep. Did you see anyone the night? No. You got out of work? Limelight in Tuggeranong 2. No. We changed though because people sat too close to us. Do you recall how much every ticket was? Uh, no, but I do know that they're $9.90 each and it was $36 something for, um, two tickets, a choc top and a medium-sized popcorn deal thing. I don't know. Quite large. They're pretty big. Was that a flavoured choc top? Yep, it was mint. Do you remember what time you left? Uh, oh, 30, um, that we got there, 30, 30, no. But it would have been about quarter to nine or something. Did you go to any spoiler there? Yeah, we went to, um, Coles beforehand. Did you buy a case of beer there? No. You hadn't run out yet? No. What coloured, uh, paint were you using? Grey or something silver. Do you know what brand? No, I didn't buy it. Possibly Dulux, Bunnings. No, I don't know. I'd assume Bunnings though. And is there a roof on the pergola? Not yet. What style roof are you putting on? Uh, I can't remember that plasticky stuff. Oh, probably. We didn't. You're a drip. Yeah. Has your husband been painting pergola? Or is it just... Oh, he's mostly been doing it. I just help. First time you painted? Yes, yeah, yep. You're lucky up to now. Yeah. Can you remember the last time you were at a station? Yes. It was Corwell, uh, and that was last week. No, I can't remember. Do you always go to the same? Oh, generally it's really close to the house. Chain of... Caltex Woolworth. Do you know any? No. Can you remember the last... Uh, yes. It was, um, after the movies last week. ANZ, yeah. Did you have to pay a fee? No. Was there anyone hanging around the ATM? No. So I've just got a list of...
