 Well, I decided to take the day off work. Told them I was sick. So I went for a drive out to the country, out near Plainlands, which is halfway between Brisbane and Toowoomba. Visited some friends who were building an octagonal home themselves from scratch, which is quite interesting. It's all starting to take shape. So I was out there for morning tea. I had morning tea with them, then went out to visit the property. And came back to their place and shared a glass of champagne, because she had just celebrated her 50th birthday and was given lots of bottles of Chandon. So we enjoyed a little bit of champagne before I headed back home. Came home through and stopped at DFO at Jindalee to purchase some shoes. Didn't have much luck with that. Walked around, tried every shoe shop that was there. Some have closed down. And left without purchasing anything. And then I came straight home. Traveled home there along the Centenary motorway through to Indooroopilly and then to home. Dinner, I had already put some silver side or corn meat in the crock pot or slow cooker. Crock pot apparently is an old term. In the slow cooker. And my husband cooked, made a lovely mustard sauce. And we had some steamed potatoes and some carrots and broccoli, I think. And had that for dinner with some leftover birthday cake from my friend for dessert. And that was pretty. Oh, we watched My Kitchen Rules Grand Final on Sunday night. It was no surprise. They were our tip. Yes. But I was very surprised to read in the paper on Sunday morning that they had filmed two endings. They had filmed endings with both couples winning. Yes. Yeah. And then put one to air. So I thought, how fake was that to film two endings and both thinking, oh, we won. And then there were like glitter falling. And then only one of them actually goes to air. It's quite bizarre. Quite bizarre. Yes, definitely. But it was nice. Four people who didn't win. Yeah. So what time did you wake up? 9 o'clock. And was it the new cook? Yes, it was a bit late. Were there people in the office at that when you cooked? Yes. And what time did you? Probably about 10.30. Yes. Two pieces of toast with avocado, salt, and pepper. So you left home at 10.30. How long did you cook? 40 minutes. Yes. How far? They were about to put the roof on. Octagonal. Quite amazing. Now the rooms are looking bigger than what I thought they would. But they've got beautiful views across every angle of the house. It's in bush, high on a hill. Yeah, it's quite amazing. So what's in the center? The kitchen, and a living area, and a dining room. And then three bedrooms off the house. Each bedroom opens out with French doors onto a veranda. There must be three verandas looking at different aspects. And then the bathroom. So I think around the side, three bedrooms, and a bathroom, and a laundry. And the living area in the middle. And I think they're planning on to have some natural light in the middle of the roof. And so do all the bedrooms and stuff? Yeah, the outside wall. Yes. But there's straight walls, and then a narrower wall where the door is. Yeah. Yeah. And how did that happen? I don't know. Michael came up with it. He's building it. He started building it before he met Karen, so I'm not sure. He's had the plans drawn up himself. And it actually looks really nice on the block. Yeah? So they've been doing it for a while? He's been doing it for about four years. Oh, wow. So you mentioned he had a morning shed. Their house was all set up? No, no. A house that they've bought to live in. Because he was living in the shed on the building site. And now that they're together, they bought a house that they've just tidied up. They intend to either sell that or rent that out when they move into the uptake little house. So it's only about two or three kilometers away, at Plainlands. Yeah. So what did you have for breakfast? Leftover birthday cake. Yeah. And some champagne? And some champagne. Yeah, very nice, Ethan. So how long? Probably left at about three. Oh, at the other house? Oh, we were in there for about an hour. OK. And then? For morning tea, we were all up. All up? Maybe two hours, three hours, maybe the most. So did you have lunch there as well? No, about three-ish. And how far away? 35 minutes. So you spent a little while looking for shoes? About an hour. Yeah? Yeah. Three. Three. One shut down. I was expecting four. There were three shops. Oh, potted in the linen shop. But that was all. Yeah, nothing much. It's a very small DFO. Did you pick up anything then? No. No. No. So you headed home after? I did. Corned meat, what was that? I put that in the morning before I left at about 10-ish, and my husband turned it off at 4. And you're walking? Yes. Yes, that's why. And it also means dinner's cooked. Yes. Pretty much. So did you prepare the veggies? No, my husband did that too. So what time? 6. And the birthday cake? It was Karen's cake. It was some sort of vanilla beans, lemon syrup cake or something. Yeah. Nice. Yes, very nice. And did you wear a smile? Yes, we were. And how long did you do it? That's a good question. I think maybe 6.30 to 8.30 or something. Yeah, maybe it was a two-hour thing. And did they have fugitive? Five. They had to do a five-course meal. Very close. Did you not watch it? No. Oh, no. Do you know who won? Well, I've seen it in the paper. Paper. I never got into it. I don't know. Oh, didn't you? I think it's one of those things you have to start. You do. You have to start otherwise. We didn't miss an episode. It kind of went dragged on, though. Yes, because it was larger. The competition was larger than last year, because it ran two teams. But no, two Queensland teams, and there was only two points between them. So they both did amazing five-course meals. So there wasn't any pause between them? It was better. It was little things, just little tiny things. Like one dessert was too sweet, and something that was a little dry. That was about it. Otherwise, they were beautifully prepared. And technique, just amazing. Their home cook can do things like that. Like, do you know, are you familiar with the term confit? Confit is cooked in oil. And one did potatoes, and the other one did duck. And it was cooked in oil for two and a half hours. So it was very tender, but apparently it was a little dry. They took it off the bone. And that's what the young couple from the Sunshine Coast. 60, I think. 60. So it was 52 and 54. Yes. Yes, very tiny. So did you watch anything else when that had finished? No. Oh, no, that's not true. I think I might have watched The Midwife Sunday night. I started recording it, but then got hooked in. It's set in the 60s, I think, in England. Yeah, I think I did. I watched The Midwife. So what time? Oh, no, that was Sunday night. I'm getting confused with Sunday night. MKR was Sunday night. That wasn't yesterday, was it? Yesterday was Monday. Oh, that's right. Anyway, both nights I was in bed by 10 o'clock. You confuse me now. So did you call in from your friend's house on Sunday? No. It was yes. Yeah, no, I called in sick. So you woke up about 9 o'clock yesterday? Yes. Were you woken up by your alarm, or did you wake up? I just woke up. I'm going to ask you a series of questions, and you're going to respond with no comment. No comment. I'm going to confuse them. You confused myself? Did you wake up at 9 o'clock yesterday? No comment. Did you call in? No comment. Is your friend Bill? No comment. Birthday? No comment. Did you go shoe shopping in the afternoon? No comment. No comment. Did you make vegetables for dinner? No comment. No comment. No comment. No comment. I'm going to alter my own then. Can't even lie correctly. I did some of that on Sunday. And I am building an octagonal home. It sounds like something you've seen on our design. Yes. In fact, leave this here. In fact, some friends of ours who have other projects.
