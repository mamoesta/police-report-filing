 yesterday okay so yesterday was wednesday and my day started with a 9am lecture um afterwards we had a group work due which then we we worked on it um one of the guys was really annoying sacking off not not doing anything at all not even wanting to be there which is like i feel like i would be the minimum requirement after which we submitted the essay and then we had a break went to my lecture because of my class whole day in terms of class from 9 to 5 finished that and then we had our first so pro meeting with um three squad leaders and the social program ot we just discussed what we what we were interested in taking over in terms of particular activities and days um any other cool stuff sat down paired up um decided to do our own pairing of double squad leaders and then um afterwards we oh um they had dinner but i couldn't because i went home and studied for my exam on monday then i studied the whole well went to bed about 10 got up this morning did a bit of reading then came to uni for this yesterday i got about one and a half hours by public transport 7 30 um mom gives me a lift to eastwood station uh catch an express to east from eastward to central then central at on at eddie's avenue we catch waited for a bus the express bus to get to uni not really well in terms of actual traveling time no but um for me to be on time for class and like because 9 a.m usually there are a lot of people at central just waiting for the same bus so i give myself some time for like waiting waiting around i guess i got to uni about 15 to 9 no yeah 8 45 got a coffee from coffee cut and then um and then walked down to my lecture at macaulay theater the group work it was an um essay summary that we have to follow up on a presentation but then um uh yeah that guy didn't want to do anything so it was um another guy and i we just finished it off i have no idea maybe we should ask him why but i don't know maybe he was he had an assignment due today so he was working on that and maybe he's not interested in doing getting it done and he feels like he can get away without getting it done no i i was so angry i wanted to talk to a lecturer i for the class that we handed in and say that can you mark the girl and i as one group and then give him an individual mark um we decided to say that at the end of the tutorial that by the end of the tutorial i was kind of like i calmed down and i wasn't that angry at my well i'll let it go no i've calmed down about it i don't mind i know that i've done i've done the work and as long as i got my marks that i deserve i'm happy if he feels like he can get away with it he can go for that but i don't feel like he can get away with it for two for too long anyway so whatever i've calmed down about it not that angry anymore so i'm like i'll let it go we didn't end up working with him he didn't do any like well he did do some things he did do a summary but he just wasn't like he only did the parts where we asked him to and in terms of finalizing everything and collaborating ideas he was just sitting there saying oh i don't know how to do this i don't know what we're talking about i can't be bothered yeah that's all so i don't feel like he's done anything i don't know i was just sitting there listening to uh it was because that subject we have presentations each week from different groups and it's an assessment just listening to them and then talking is well just sitting down and calming myself down i can't remember i didn't feel as angry and i'm like it's not really necessary to just dub him in again uh no i finished all my group work oh no there is another group work for accounting not for this subject so this subject i'm done until a mid-session exam and a final i went to all my classes yeah so there was a break during then it was a nine to five straight so we get i get two one and a half hours break in between the whole day and during that break we did the work it was like my first first week out of my five weeks that i've been to all my classes so proud of myself i didn't have time with like meetings or um i was really sick or tired i can't be bothered yeah some because some lecturers are too annoying do i do the work that i miss in class yes i catch up on readings by myself because sometimes i don't feel like i need to sit in class to get someone to read it read out what the lecture content is to me without when they don't like when they don't talk us through it or explain it they just they should read it out and i'm well i can do that and save some traveling time and all that no public transport yes because it was um peak hour at nine coming in the traffic would be quite bad and i didn't finish uni that late i didn't feel like i needed to drive back home um on the late nights of uni so whenever there is like meetings or med review stuff i do drive um maybe give a give a take um three or four times every month it was really fun it was really fun um we yeah it was it was good because it wasn't like we all knew each other beforehand but it was nice to like work with them so to speak because it's so it's so different from the other times that we've interacted with each other okay no comment no comment no comment No comment.
