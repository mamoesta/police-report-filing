 currently by that mode. Okay so yesterday I woke up in the morning I usually wake up quite early around quarter to six and basically I get up and I have my shave I have my breakfast I have my coffee then I get ready for the day and then I take my little doggie out and make sure he's gone out to the toilet and stuff like that and then yeah and then um yeah basically make sure he's okay my partner works from home so she was her last day at work yesterday so she's starting a new job next week and so yeah but she's got to stay off as an annual leave day so um yeah so it was her last day she was trying to get everything done and organized and ready and that kind of thing she's feeling quite guilty about leaving some things undone I'm just telling her not to worry about it so don't don't care too much you know you're leaving after all so yeah and then yesterday as a work day I actually I think I came in yeah no it was a pretty normal day actually for work yeah it was yeah it was almost the end of the week so I was kind of like going oh gosh hurry up and this week be over so and yeah and then last night I suppose we left and we went over to my mom's house I haven't seen my mom for a little couple of weeks so we went and saw her in the afternoon and then we um yeah we actually took her out for dinner so we just went and had Chinese up the road and yeah basically caught up with her and yeah she really enjoyed that and that yeah that was my day yesterday but in terms of work it was pretty quiet I usually work an 8-4 so yeah I was in I was in a little bit after 8 and I left a little bit after 4 I think it was so it was a fairly yeah fairly fairly average day I've got a lot to do at the moment but sometimes it's hard just to pick yourself up and get motivated for the day so but yeah it was good to have more of a productive day today it's good so um yeah that was my day everywhere every morning I say my life of 545 no not the weekend no no not the weekends no even though I can't really sleep in past 7 yeah pretty hopeless I'll try now I can't for person is I won't I'll just keep falling asleep now I'm very like my time my whole morning depends on getting up at 545 so I'm kind of like kind of regimented in the mornings not generally a regimented person but in the mornings yeah I like to try and be out the door by 10 past 7 and that's a fairly long gap between quarter to 5 and 10 absolutely absolutely coffee before I can even function so just right a little bit just right yeah if I have I find that if I have a toast I get a bit over it after a couple of days so I just go up so yeah just right yeah just right yeah yeah he just he just runs around I just try and get into the toilet so just so he can hang inside for the day so I lost out so so he's um like a shih tzu a bit different so yeah absolutely yeah yeah well he's like yeah he's good outside like he's very he's not a princess or anything he's really he loves big dogs he loves a rover and tumble he loves playing in the park and things like that but yeah definitely inside dog yeah yeah absolutely he's a good boy yeah it's a really good dog yeah I try and leave home at 10 past 7 I come along from Kenmore so I've got a bit of a funny run-in so sometimes it's um yeah sometimes if I leave a little bit later I can get the traffic and get really bad so I try and try I'm out the door by 10 past but generally it's not really till 20 past 10 so the morning went well actually drive depending so if I if I if I drive to Indooroopilly I'll get the train and it's just what the train turns up I'd like to just be here by 8 if I can so if I leave if I leave home at 10 past 7 I will drive to work and get to work generally by 8 o'clock generally in the doorway because I park across the road so yeah no I drove yeah drove yesterday so $10 parking it's pretty good yeah my partner starts a new job on Monday and so we'll be driving because it's gonna be cheaper than getting the train so it'd be just cheap for us to drive so yeah it was I did have quite a few things I like mornings like I'm more of a morning person than afternoon so I find myself getting more done in the morning than an afternoon so I had a really productive morning afternoon was a bit you know a bit tapered so I did think I did I think I had a couple of meetings on you know but um kind of stuff wasn't that relevant to me but I still had to be so yeah yeah but do we ever each have a 10 o'clock meeting every day and but I'm also involved in a release happening on Monday night and there's these meetings about that so in the lead-up to that on Monday night so it's a couple of meetings about that as well so that's all that it's all our team so generally between we skipped between seven and ten people yeah and yeah Rob usually holds that oh I can't remember my mind's pretty hopeless probably seven okay yeah I think it was around 1230 yeah no I should be but I bought it yesterday I usually try and make my lunch if I can yeah not today yeah I went down to 400 George and I had chicken with rice yeah and some water I've always got water mmm some weird thing we have here we always come back to the office for some reason we never tend to eat out so I accepted but um yeah so we brought back to the office and ate it but even even then we just sit there and keep it going it's really quite fun we all go out together we get lunch together with a go-to keep on going yeah thanks oh yeah for each yeah look it was okay the run home is never that great it's usually worse it's not worse in the mornings but yeah it just depends yeah but yes that was okay yeah it was fine I think it's all time by nearly back quarter five yeah between 1445 yeah no I went home waited for my partner to finish off her work and log out and then we went to mum's I think around six no I think we popped in there for about 20 minutes then we just headed up the road yeah so not too long at all yeah no no we were in it's out there it's really casual out there I ordered a short soup and my partner ordered some wonton thing so my mum had a chicken sweetcorn soup and then for mains it's funny cuz our Chinese for lunch and Chinese for dinner so for mains we had sweet and sour chicken and mum ordered lemon chicken so a couple of chickens then we had some fried rice I thought two mains was enough we didn't need a third so yeah oh no look I know we boxed we boxed the lemon chicken we gave it to mum to have lunch today or whatever she wants to do with it so yeah yeah they're a little bit busy last night I think we waited I'm not too long probably 15 minutes long at all really yeah drop mum at home I actually dropped my girlfriend up at um up at the local shops and she actually did some shopping at the shops after Chinese so we let her go and do that now went back to mum's and we hung out there for a bit and then I picked her up we went home so a bit later on think we want Hell's Kitchen yeah yeah it's from the US but yeah yeah yeah it's still him mm-hmm it's the third episode so that's about the blue team in the red team yeah and three weeks in you're pretty hopeless at the moment so as they generally are as they start so yeah oh I think the red team did the boys have been pretty hopeless so I'm yeah the red team won the moment yeah but then oh I think I'll change later on I think 1030 I'd like to be bit but I think was around 1030 yeah no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment Nerd comment!
