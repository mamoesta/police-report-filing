 Um, I got up at around 8.30. Um, I had a cup of coffee. Um, I then did a little bit of cleaning. Um, then I, I also did a little bit of, um, looking around on the internet, furniture. Um, then I, um, had a shower and, oh, I did my washing and hung it up. Then I drove to the beach. Um, then I was probably there for about two hours. Um, drove home. I think then, yes, I had something to eat. I had a nap, um, for maybe, um, then I woke up. I spoke to a couple of people on the phone. Then I, um, had another shower and then, um, got a lift to a friend's house. And then from there we went to the spa and then home a few hours. Um, I ate a grape. I took my makeup off. Um, yes, because I saw what I thought might be a cockroach in my way. Um, so I, yeah, no, I went to bed pretty much, pretty soon. No, I didn't. I made it, um, in the Kona. Um, I have it white with sugar. Yeah. Um, at least an hour. Yeah. Yeah, I think I did the washing. I put the washing on, then did the cleaning. Um, furniture. Um, two or three. And no, I drove. Yeah, I drove. No, I didn't get lift. It was free. No, free because it was free. I was parked in a four-hour zone. Um, we arranged to meet at 11.30, but I didn't get down there until probably after. Um, yeah, it was in the morning. It was probably, yeah, about an hour before that. So around 10, I think. Um, yes. Um, well, it was just one back, one to me, and one replied with one person. And then I met two others. Um, well, one of them I hadn't spoken to before I went down. So there were one, there were four. Yes, there were four. No, I didn't. No. Yeah, don't mind, didn't have one on Saturday. Exactly. Um, no, actually, oh, one of them I had seen at the beach, but no. Oh, actually, yeah, sorry. She was at the beach. I hadn't spoken to her before. Um, no, it was pre-organ for that. Yeah. Um, just after 12.30, I think it was. It took an hour to get parked. Pretty much, yeah. Yeah. There's no paid spots. There was just no parking at all. I, it was a bit of a walk. Um, I probably, no, I didn't get there at 11.30. I got there just after 30. I arranged. Um, so I probably left at around, around three. Yeah. Yeah, I had, um, a little bit of, no, I had some rock melon and some drinks. Um, no, I got a lift to my friend's house since the taxi was home that night after the bar. Um, I got there, there at 30, I think. So I think I ended up getting there at around, just after seven. Um, I wasn't picked up. I got a lift from my mum. Um, maybe an hour and a half. Yeah. We got a lift from her. Um, Flinders Street. Flint Street. Yeah. Near Noah Special. No, not really. Not at all, actually. No, it was really quiet when we got there and then it got really busy and no, not really. Just catching up with my friends. No. Oh, there was a famous person there. Someone from Hemingway was there. Probably it. C-grade celebrity. Really? Yeah. Uh, no. Um, I only had one drink there. Um, no, pretty standard. No, I caught the taxi with, um, one friend got out first and then another friend and then I was last. They, no, they gave me some money. I paid the rest. It was $30.
