 yesterday, I have a memory so bad, went straight to the city for, I don't know, straight to the city, met up with someone, then came to the Paparodni Uni for a meeting, got a sponsor for an event, then went to the city, visited another sponsor, gave them some flyers and stuff, then popped into another potential sponsor, turned them into a sponsor, went to UTS library, just consolidated some tickets and stuff, what else? Didn't get to have dinner, was too busy and then somehow it turned out to be 9pm, went home, looked on Facebook and saw someone else's wall post, realised I have an exam tomorrow, that's not too good, so gotta start studying for that and fell asleep. I was either 10 or 12, big gap, no, no uni or anything for once, an hour after I woke up, whenever that was, I think it was 12, I must have woken up at 10 then, just one bus, L85 normally, L85, yeah, so it goes through from DUI, Pookvale, crosses Spit Bridge, Mossman, Neutral Bay, Harbour Bridge, Wynyard, I wish it would go to Central, yeah but not from my stop, yeah, caught a train, yeah, and another bus to uni, or around uni at least, I do normally but I'm finding it's a bit faster if you just go through Central and I did meet someone there yesterday so thought it'd be easier, an hour and a half, yeah, considering I took it slow but then again it wasn't peak hour so maybe it was a bit slow, yeah, got an event coming up next month and really desperately need to get it organised, not really happening too well, most of the staff are about to get kicked out because they're useless and the person in charge is overseas and giving us really, really bad directions, like only tells us stuff a few weeks before the concert when really we should know it way before, ah it's tough, it's for her, it's like it's either my way or the highway, like she actually said it, if you don't like what I'm doing get out, but we do tell her everything that we want improved or whatever we need, takes it kind of on but there's some things she just won't budge on, so there's a lot of freedom on how we achieve what she wants but if we want something achieved it might not really be according to a plan, ah yeah, right now technically unpaid since there's no money until after concert happens, yeah, it's actually better than, because I have another job on the side which is retail which is very boring, it's just enough to get money sort of thing but honestly I'd rather get no money and feel like I'm making a difference in something than just be a guy standing at a counter as a cog helping out with stuff, yeah, ah three yesterday which is pretty good but didn't realise it would take so long as well, more the merrier so not really any targets for it, ah well we were going for food sponsors yesterday so we got three meals out of it's either nine or twelve because we still don't know how many days they're even going to be here thanks to the person in charge not telling us, October 5th Melbourne, October 7th Sydney, um it's actually a k-pop concert and it's basically aimed at charity, um it's for a charity that deals with eye disease called Retinitis Pigmentosa, I don't know much about it but um frankly I don't think it's gonna be much of a charity concert if we're gonna make a loss so, um I used to do events through other stuff um and it was mainly just clubbing and stuff, got over it thought I want to go for what I'm passionate for so I approached them, I told them my experience pretty much in two months got to one of the executive positions, no uh don't really mind, for now I'm still just trying to experience build especially since I don't actually want to do any management later what I want to do is um be a tv host so I don't really care, so pretty much through this since you meet so many managers and stuff and you get so much exposure pretty much just use the connections through this and next year I'm going to go overseas to Korea which is where I want to do it and stuff, um I kind of lost those connections due to falling outs and stuff but the people that I'm with now they should be able to help at least yeah yeah to the extent yeah I guess yeah, um we were supposed to meet them later in the week but we just popped in and yeah luckily they were still there the manager so um no a lot of other stuff to do way too busy should be studying now but no I guess I'll just cram, supposed to have a party tonight as well but that's not gonna go too well 12% and it's a subject it's like one it's the only subject I care about just because I find it entertaining and stuff should only be actually might be a while a few hours four or five hours I don't even know I just saw it on somebody else's wall I was like I don't know about this, I don't look at it, I haven't studied in like two months been way too busy yeah..no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment No comment.
