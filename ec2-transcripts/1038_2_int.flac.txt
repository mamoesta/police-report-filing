 Sunday was... I don't know what to do. I had to drive my sister to her fiance's house because I wanted the car. That was later at night. During the day, it was a rainy day. Sunday was a rainy day. I remember I was waking up thinking do I work today? My boss told me that he wanted me on Sunday but he never confirmed the time. So I was more waiting for a call to see if I was going to be working or not. Come one o'clock, that's when he usually calls me by. But no phone call for work. So I just stayed home for the rest of the afternoon and then I had plans to go to a friend's house later that night. That's why I wanted the car so I could drive it. So I had to drive my sister to her fiance's house. 10? 10 o'clock? Usual time. Yeah, just mostly surf the net, check emails, play games. I don't remember. Maybe just 5. Mostly friends. Yeah, around there. Probably ate around 8. Yeah, probably ate around 1. I think I had pizza. I had leftover pizza from the other day. No, no. I reheated it. I prefer that kind of pizza over the cold and just brand new ordered. Just day old. Yeah. Yeah, local. Always local. Yeah, it was okay. Nothing too special. I think I had a supreme and some other one my brother likes. I don't know what it's called though. Just olives, mushrooms and bacon. No garlic bread that day. I had to kill time before the dinner. Yeah, I played games. Battlefield. That was the last time. Yep. No, no. I had dinner at the friend's place. It was a friend's gathering. We left around 5. Got there about 5.30. Light drizzle around that time. Traffic was okay. Couldn't complain. Half an hour. 20 minutes to half an hour. Yeah, that's the usual time. She always prefers a lift there. She doesn't like driving for some reason. No, not yet. They plan to live together when starting next year. Just a few months before the marriage. Yep. Which is only about a 5 minute drive from fiance's house. I think there was about 7, 8 of us. Yeah, all close friends. All from high school. High school friends still keep in contact for some reason. Yeah, so 10 years now? No, it was just a gathering. Just for the fun of it. No, nothing. One of our old friends that we haven't seen in years came over as well. So that was a good catch up with him. He's one of the special people in the group. He's like a genius. He's doing medicine. But he also has had a lot of family problems. Haven't seen him in ages. Ever since high school finished. So about 5 years now. No, about 5 other people. About 5. I can't count who was there right now. Stayed there till about 10.30. So that'd be 5 hours. Dinner was dumplings and noodles with curry. Yeah, everything was homemade. So it was nice. And we all helped out to make it. Yeah, just a little bit. Yeah, everyone's helpful. There's only one good cook in the group. And he mostly made everything. It was his house so he had to take care of it. Nah, I got a bit lazy towards that time. No, we all drove. No one called a taxi. Nah, I drove myself. Then I had to pick up my sister on the way back home. And that was it. Yeah, she got lucky that night. Around 11. Surfed the net again. Then just went to sleep. Yesterday, watched a movie yesterday. Before that was lunch. Had yum cha. That was very nice. And then after the movie and lunch it was straight to work. It's very tiring. Tiring place to work. We got there at 12. Probably ate till about 1. 1 o'clock. Yeah, we tried to. That's how you eat yum cha. No, it was at Rhodes. Phoenix. Have you had that before? Try Rhodes Phoenix. It's one of the most talked about places for yum cha. Yeah, the movie was at Reading Cinema which is just downstairs from the yum cha place. We watched New Year's Eve. Nah, I didn't think it was that bad. But the other people that watched it with us, they didn't really like it that much. Yeah, I was with them for dinner the night before as well. No, no, it was just a small group that time. There were four of us all together for lunch and movie. We drove. I picked everyone up and then we all drove to Rhodes. Nah, I dropped them off and then I went to work. Yeah, pretty much. Bit of both. Maybe between half an hour and an hour. There were three people I dropped off. Between 6 to 11, 5 hours. No, they're separate friends. They were just work friends. Yeah, I dropped one of my workmates off because he lives close by and he usually walks to work and prefers not to walk at night. Yep. No comment. Cold. Let's pull it out.
