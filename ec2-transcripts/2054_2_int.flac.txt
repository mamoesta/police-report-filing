 Yesterday was Tuesday. So Tuesday I woke up quite early because Finnegan got up and he was beating me with something. I think he had my phone actually and was giving me a phone and then his dad got up and took him downstairs. Um, they came back up gave me a coffee it would have been about 7 30. No that would have been seven o'clock and then I fell back asleep because then Jai came back in at 7 30. He said you better get up and I said yes my best. So we went, got ready for work um and then caught the train at about nine o'clock. Yeah nine o'clock and then came to work did the usual check the email have coffee that sort of stuff and then I had to go to for a walk down the street to go to the dentist. I made it to the dentist with about two minutes to spare before my appointment time which I thought was pretty excellent. So I sat there and had to wait probably about three minutes before I got in to see the dentist. I was there for about half an hour and I walked back to work so all up around trip that was about an hour out of work um and then I think I might have come up here not long after that and did some more recording work for our training package. Ran through that a couple of times up here went back to the office had lunch and then uh proceeded to do some more research on some biological exhibits sample collection what sort of samples people are collecting how they're recording them um worked on a report in relation to that and by then I think it was about home time so I hopped on the train and headed home. Train ride was fairly uneventful which is always nice um I had dinner which was good and then I had to laugh because I was watching Finnegan eat his dinner and he got to the point where he'd obviously had enough and then proceeded to throw peas and corn onto the ground. I sat there and said stop doing that Finnegan that's naughty no don't do it he just looked at me and smiled and he continued to throw his food on the ground so we made him sit in the chair until we got the dog in we call it our canine vac he came in and cleaned up the floor for us um I had a bit of stuff to do with the football club last night I had to redraft a letter and have a look at a few accounts and those sorts of things bits and pieces I did that all before dinner anyway had a look at some new plans that the council had sent through for redesigning the football club and the baseball club um my husband had a look at those as well and then we talked about how it would look at the end of it at that stage we were chasing children to go to bed the older boy was a little bit excited because he had an excursion today so he had to get up and beat school by quarter past seven so he was packing his lunch and getting his water bottles and all this ready and having conversations with us about um going to bed in his school uniform so we had to tell him no he's going to bed in your pajamas you'll be up in plenty of time to get dressed for school um but our middle child he was making his lunch and it was already past his bedtime and he decided that he should pre-pack his lunch so this morning he's sitting there at seven o'clock going I'm ready for school mum can I go and I don't know you can't go to school with Declan because there's going to be no one up there to look after you so you need to stay here we'll ring your friend his best mate lives at the end of our street and I said so you can ring him so let's see if he can you can stay there till it's time to go to school and you can walk to school to get lost but yeah that was quite funny watching him try to get used to it and then getting roused on because he was still up quarter past eight and my husband got quite cranky with him and said stop wasting time I was sick of these shenanigans no I was he said I think I watched a bit of tv and then went to bed I don't think I even read last night I was that tired no yes my alarm clock yes no I always take it back downstairs with me probably about half an hour yes I did fetch mine no no yes I think I did from like Northgate um Game of Thrones the third book I can't remember the title I just read them probably about quarter of the way no well that seems to go on all day really so they come in it's constantly open but the bulk of them was dealt with probably in 10 minutes oh 10 minutes yes no I had to wait a little while I did I read a book on on root canals actually they had a little folder it seemed like a long time but I think realistically it was only half an hour 20 minutes no no video probably about 10 minutes all up it's just a small training package well it's a few different options but generally to use scenes of crime nothing ah stir-fried rice yeah yes no well the report's only a page long it's the content that's proven to be difficult to actually clarify everything and make sure the parameters are set no I'm hoping it'll be finished this afternoon no no yes football ads in union yeah I'm on their committee I'll probably be on the committee this year I try not to try to limit it to at least just one day it's gonna work no it's probably 45 minutes all up yeah the boys all play union my husband's a union mad fan so he dedicated yes no my husband oh we had steak and vegetables and there was definitely peas and corn apparently so I was very surprised peas and corn um I forget one of the islands that they had to come down to Linton to go to just a day trip yeah he was trying to tell me it was Tanglooma but it's not I think St. Helene's Island might be, St Helena I think it is called think might be the whole grade um last night yeah we did actually news was on big bang theory i think was on last night so we watched that would have been about 10 9 30 10 no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment, and I'll comment.
