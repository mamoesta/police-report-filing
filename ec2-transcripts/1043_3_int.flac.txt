 today. I woke up, had breakfast, which was cereal with milk, and then got driven to the station and then caught a train in and then caught a bus in and then randomly on the bus I saw my cousin so I chatted with her for a while and then came into uni at about 9.45, went to the library to get some work done and then bumped into a yellow shirt so I had a chat with them and then I went to contact where I got a bit of work done and then I started socializing with the other volunteers and then it was yeah pretty much from the morning was most of it was spent in contact socializing and then we had lunch and I had a pasta with meatballs and it wasn't very good and it made me really regret not getting the mushroom risotto and then went back to contact prepared a bit for my meeting with my supervisor so I did a bit of reading I did a bit of research there then wrote down notes for what I was going to say in my meeting and then it was my meeting at two so I went up there and then was pretty much just chatting to my supervisor about the project yeah and then just I guess making her realize that I have actually been working on it and so we went through the whole we went through each section of the proposal that was meant to be done and what I'd done for it and then I was asking about methodology and so we got a lot of that sorted out and so seems like I'm not actually behind at all but it was just because the lack of contact made her think that and I also found out she's going away for six weeks to Europe starting at June so I'll probably have to try and get a lot of stuff done before then but yeah and then that was that meeting and then I went back after that meeting went back to contact to just wait around and then I saw Jeff and then so I had a quick chat to Jeff and it was really nice and then I came here my what I had cereal so it wasn't left over nope no um I my alarm went off at seven and I kept snoozing it every five minutes so I ended up getting out of bed around 7 30.
