 Saturday I woke up and I had my neck was extremely sore I had no idea why I guess it must have been the way I slept I must have slept funny yeah and then I think I had breakfast I yeah I had breakfast then I don't know what I did I think gave I watched TV or I was on my laptop killing time until I had work at 12 o'clock at BW and then a BW I was on the checkout five hours which was a lot of fun and then after BW I went home and then I I I was meant to either go have dinner with my girlfriend and her two friends or I was meant to hang out with my other two friends but I ended up doing neither and I stayed home because I was feeling really sore well my neck was really sore still because I guess work didn't help and yeah all the cool kids stayed home on Saturday nights probably nine o'clock I would have I probably would have ate breakfast while I watched TV and then I probably went and went on my laptop and just went on Facebook and YouTube and whatever else I could do to kill time no because I just I really should I just don't because I don't like studying not really yeah I study for exams and yeah that's it yeah but then I don't really I do them in the tutorial while they go through the questions yeah yeah I think well yes no I mean I don't know I wasn't bored I was doing interesting stuff I just don't remember what the stuff was oh terrible because I just stand there and work for five hours and my neck was sore so I didn't want to move much and the lights are too bright at BW and I always get a headache and it's just not an enjoyable retail is not fun I was being sarcastic a lot of the time yes because I don't particularly like my supervisor and there's not much else to do there's yeah there really isn't much else to do happy W I could go stand at the door and check people's bags when they walked in and out of the store but that's I probably like that more but I can't be bothered time goes a lot slower doing that but I don't mind it probably to do the door yeah but I don't I hate doing checkouts I can't yeah I don't know just it's very long you don't have any you always have to be doing something I like to standing at the door because then checking people's bags I can just stand there and not do anything no never well I wouldn't say I've caught them if someone's come up with something in the bag I'm like oh hey what's that they've been like oh no I must have forgot to pay for that but that really happens I've never caught anyone for shoplifting oh well I'd say more often people leave the store and then about like 10 steps out they'll come rushing back in being like oh my god I walked out with this essentially well if people walk in asking hey where do I find shoes I'll point them in that direction so other than that maybe not really customer service I could well I probably need to be trained for that if I really really wanted to I could ask them hey could I I've been here well could I like it trained to do other stuff but I really hate working at BW and I'm planning on leaving BW as soon as I get another job or other income I'm applying to internships to do during the summer and so hopefully if I get one of them I can will not work at BW during the holidays and then also I'll save up heaps of money during the internship and then hopefully if the company likes me I can get part-time work like once a week or something like that anything to get out of BW um well there's nowhere else to apply if I worked in another retail place the reason I like we're gonna be W is in I don't like the work but everything else is really good the pay is really good and the flexibility is really good as well if I don't want to do a shift it's so easy to get it replaced where if I want extra work I can just tell one of my supervisors hey I want some extra work can you get me some and most weeks I'll have it to get me an extra shift or at least one extra shift if I really want so the flexibility is just really good why don't I go out I always feel I always have a little bit of a headache after work and the fact that my neck is really sore as well I just didn't want to go out yes no not during work had it before work at it right before 12 o'clock no it's it's it's like I get a 15-minute break during the five hours and I can take the 15-minute break nearly anytime I want during that time so yeah no you can't take the break in the last hour well legally you can't or technically you can't but I still do sometimes anyway afterwards I was I don't know same as before I just watch I think probably watch TV and then I think I was playing a game on my old Xbox yeah he wasn't bad I could have had more fun if I went out but it wasn't like I was like upset that I was at home on a Saturday night yes I it was sore for Saturday but then on Sunday I woke up and I was feeling a lot better yes no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no
