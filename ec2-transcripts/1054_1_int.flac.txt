 yesterday morning okay um so yesterday morning was an early morning because i had basketball in the morning um so that meant that i woke up at what was it eight um so i mean i had to wake up at about um i had to wake up at seven o'clock so i got up at seven o'clock and then i started to get ready which i wasn't gonna have a shower because i was gonna have a shower at uni so i just got myself packed because i had basketball and then i also had to go to uni afterwards so i'm packing my stuff to change into and it also meant taking my laptop and my books for doing work at university so um that's what happened um then i had checks for breakfast they were kind of stale i think i should throw them out um and then i went to uni um got to uni played basketball first match was a bye because they didn't have any girls on their team it's meant to be a mixed team um and then after that i played a second game of basketball that was actually good because i could actually you know score a basket so far my shooting percentages are really low um and that sucks because you know i think the first game i shot took four shots scored no baskets this game i shot seven shots and i scored one basket um and even the girls in my team have a higher shooting percentage than i do that's you know i'm not you know sexist or anything but that's still not awesome um and then what happened was after that went and had a shower got ready for class first stuff in the day um i skipped my first class to do one of my online tests that i remember that i had to get done so i did that did okay didn't do that great could have done better um then i had lunch which was a uh chicken roll actually no that no i had lunch before then um right after basketball actually i ate something because i was really hungry uh so i had chicken roll hung out with one of my mates um that i hadn't seen for a while and um what happened was we caught up which we haven't caught up for ages and then talked about some stuff then i saw one of my friends which i haven't seen for also another long time and that was really cool but also really awkward because he's a law student and he obviously came out with a friend of his from law that i used to date and she was really awkward which is really not cool but whatever um and then i didn't i had two classes on i went to one the second class was actually cancelled because um of this whole anzac day thing which is really weird but you know clearly we get some time off that was awesome um and then what happened after that oh yeah so i got through my work met up with a friend hung out with another friend for a while then decided i was falling asleep on everything so i decided to go home do some work got a can of v try to keep myself up with you know that sort of thing and then cook myself some dinner that brought me to be more awake i got some good study done at night and what happened after that after that uh yeah then i just did some more study then decided i was so tired that i should just go to sleep so i went on the internet for a bit as i do every night wasted so much time on the internet um and once i finished checking the internet and facebook and everything like that i went to bed and that was pretty much everything that happened for that day was i meant to tell you what's happening today as well okay i had checks they were stale they were terrible checks are a wheat cereal i think i don't know it's okay it's chocolate coated sugar basically that's all it is like it's wheat somewhere in there but it's really just sugar and chocolate milk and it's made by the same people that make cocoa puffs pops whatever and really tastes really yum if they're really fresh but they were stale milk full fat as that's the way only people should ever drink because anything but full fat is just um well i kind of had second breakfast after the basketball game and that was like the chicken roll that i had um it kind of what well the thing is i i also had a chicken roll like a second chicken roll for lunch so i had two lunches yeah because i also have two dinners but that two dinners is technically the same thing because like i have one round at like a time and then i just have a second round later but i call it two dinner um okay so it's the cereal and then the first chicken roll and the second chicken roll and then when i went home i cooked dinner i had two rounds of that so that's uh yeah yep nothing just milk by bus i take the bus everywhere um okay so this is basically maroubra to city and well well for maroubra you can either go to central or you can go to city um at the time and place i think i caught a city bus because you basically just catch whatever comes at the time because they both all of them go past uni so you just catch that it was you know okay quick and slow on that and far apart and when you're traveling like i think in total like an average trip is about eight minutes so it being fast is like it got there in like seven minutes if it's slow it gets there in 10 minutes so yeah i think it was about when did the supermarket to get some stuff to no the supermarket is just like basically when you catch a bus to go home um i live like a minute from the supermarket like you walk across like walk down the road to the way at the same place you would go catch the bus from go a little bit further and you get to the supermarket um but i went to supermarket not to get ingredients but to buy a v because um i was really really tired so yeah no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no
