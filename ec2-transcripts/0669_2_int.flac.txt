 Oh gosh, that could go on for a long time. Probably work backwards. Depends what you define as a job, but... I've worked for the AFP in their professional standards for the last five years, not as a police officer, as a manager and trainer for the professional standards. And probably before that I was doing business development, so going into... and that was in the community and private sector. Probably if you talk about different jobs I've had, probably the longest job I've had that I think was a job, still is a job, is being a mother. So, yeah, yeah. I started off my working career as a nurse for quite a long time, moved into management and nursing, then moved into the blood bank, managing a blood bank unit in Queensland, and that was in between. And some of that time I was just being a mother and not working for money. At Royal Newcastle Hospital, Newcastle Great Hospital on the beach. Well, it was on the beach, it's not there anymore. They're units, beautiful units on Newcastle Beach. Yeah, they moved the whole hospital back into... John Hunter, they built a really big hospital in West Newcastle. All up, on and off, probably about 15 years. And what town was it? Mount Isa, see, mining town. I went, moved from accident and emergency into Mount Isa blood bank, and that was quite interesting. One of the challenges there was, because the head office was in Brisbane, just had to do a lot of organising and managing over the long distances and that sort of thing. How far is it? About 2,000 kilometres, I think. It's a long way, yeah. Mount Isa's very remote. Six hours south of the bottom of the Gulf of Carpentaria and about a day's drive from Townsville West and a couple of days' drive to Brisbane, in the middle of nowhere. Can you tell me what the last parking ticket was? I rarely get them. I think I might have got one in Lynham when I first moved to Canberra about nine years ago. They're vicious, the parking. The parking people in Canberra are vicious. Yeah, no, it'd be a long time. I don't like giving my money away for nothing, so I'm pretty careful where I park. Have you ever had a speeding ticket? No, not my whole life. Can you tell me the last time you cashed for an ATM? I tried to this morning, but it was a new ATM and it wouldn't take the cards, so... Yep. Let me see. Oh, I can't remember. I don't do it that often. Which ATM? The ATM at the Otterman, near the EBB. So they've just put a new one there. All right. Do you know which bank? It wasn't very clear, actually. No, it had GO on it, G-O. All right. So it was really quite a different brand. I wasn't used to, so... But didn't like my card, my debit card. I don't know why they didn't want me to put my credit card in there. And the last time that you... Yes, this morning I bought a coffee and I was given $2 change. It was a large coffee. It was very nice. Do you know how many sugars were in the coffee? None. I don't have sugar. Was that on sweet milk? No. Sweet milk? No. Can you recall what you had for lunch yesterday? Yes. I had a homemade soup that I made the night before. Vegetable soup on a base of pumpkin. It was delicious. How many pumpkins? Probably about half a pumpkin. Yep. Cut up into little bits. And the pumpkin's great because it dissolves. So all the other veggies stay whole, but the pumpkin completely breaks up. So you get this lovely, creamy pumpkin. Yeah, and me too. I haven't got any left. Do you know how... It was probably about 600-700 grams, I'd say. And do you know how many days there are in October? 31. Is that little... Yes, 30 days. So September, April, June and November. 31 have all the rest, except in leap years. Way to do it. And do you know what the date is next Thursday? Ah, 24th of May. Do you know what the date was on... 25th of April. Is that a trick question? Ah, yeah, sure, I can imagine that. I'm not really good with numbers, so... Do you know which car registration? Yes, June. Have you ever... No, I don't think so. Whereabouts... Um, on the western side of EBB in the free car park. Do you recall the vehicle you parked? No, no, not at all. You parked there, was there a vehicle on the other side? No, only on one side on the right. Yep. No. I don't know if I'd tell you if I did. Just drive off. I feel bad first. And does your car have any scratches or dings from other people? It does, it does. It's probably... I was saying to Kylie the other day, it's a fairly brand new car, but it's scratched really badly and I think it's from leaving it in the public car parks around here. We normally look after our cars pretty well, but this one's not looking good at all. I'm not even sure if it's not the bad quality of the paint as well. Yep. So... So what type of car do you have? A Honda CRV. You're not going to ask me that number plate, are you? OK. I always forget mine. Can you tell me the last time you... Um, yeah, a few weeks ago, I think. Do you know which... Shell. Fill up the tank? No, I just went in and paid the bill. Do you remember how much it was? No. Um, did you put diesel or unleaded fuel in it? Unleaded. Premium. What colour was the pump for the premium? Ah, all different colours. I guess white. Do you know where you bought your shoes from? Nine West. Is that in... I know that's in Civic. Yep. How long ago did you buy those? 14, 15 months ago. Yep. When was the last time you drove over the... Oh, probably in January this year. Yep. Can you recall how many lanes there are on the bridge? Eight, I'm guessing. Did you get lost while you were in... Not usually, no. I didn't, no. I've got a GPS, which helps. Did you go on the Easter Gitter? Yes. Do you remember how much they charge? No, because we've got a little BIP, a little tag that just BIPs when you go through and you get charged on your credit card. Yep. Do you slow down to the speed when going through the... Yes. I usually obey speed signs. Seeing this is being recorded. That's a good answer. And can you remember how many flights... Two. Can I ask you the list? Mm-hmm. What is your telephone number? No comment. Is your full name... No comment. Where you driving car last... No comment. What did you have in the boot? No comment. Um, have you been in the boot? No comment. When was the last time you... Ah, no comment. What day is tomorrow? No comment. Where did you work? No comment. No comment. How often... No comment. Near a train? No comment. Were you for work today? No comment. Do you have a boat license? No comment. Do you own a boat? No comment. No comment. No comment. What is your cat's name? No comment. Do you drink coffee? No comment. Where did you have lunch? No comment. No comment.
