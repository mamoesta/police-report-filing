 Yeah, okay Easter, so what did we do Easter? So, good Friday, I just did a little bit of work in the garage, cleaned it up, and then that afternoon my brother-in-law and his family, he's got a wife and three kids, they came up from Shepparton in Victoria, and so we cooked up, being good Friday and all, we cooked up a prawn curry, steer clear of the meat, had that for dinner and they were up for the weekend. So, on Saturday morning we went shopping, they like to get out to the big department stores, they don't have too many of them in Shepparton, so we went shopping in the morning, then we went out to, on Gary's recommendation actually, we went to Tinbinbilla, out at the space station, took the kids out there, they absolutely loved it, and then we went to dinner at the Hellenic Club, got a big playroom there for the kids, watched the football that night, and then on the Sunday, on the Sunday we went and watched the Raiders game, played the New Zealand Warriors and we absolutely pumped them, which was good, could be our final win of the season, one of the injuries again, and yeah, after that we just went back to the Raiders club back in Gungahlin, had a couple of drinks and went home and had dinner, Monday morning they left, and to drive back to Shepparton I did a bit of work in the garden, and that was it, back to work on Tuesday. That particular Saturday, it was relatively early, about 8 o'clock I think, 7.30, 8 o'clock, we steer clear of the chicken, being good Friday and all, so it was a prawn, we did prawn curry, oh just the frozen ones that we got at the supermarket, ready cooked, just throw them straight in, ooh, I think I gave it a good old crack I suppose, TIDBINBILLA, yeah that's wrong, so it's out on the Cotter Road, so it's basically halfway between Woden and Tuggerong at the Cotter Road, so it's about half an hour, a little bit closer to the Tuggerong side, but it's out in the mountains, in the Brindabells, no it's free, and you see a bit of moon rock and everything, yes, yeah one was a Kia Sorento, new model, like a 2011-2012 model, it was silver in colour, that's the only one I remember, no, that was a Canberra Raiders versus a New Zealand Warriors, no no we watched that at the, oh on Saturday night was it, Saturday night, no that was the, that's a good question, that was the St George Dragons versus, mmm, Cronulla Sharks that was, yeah Cronulla won, I don't think he did, no I don't think he did, yeah it was a little bit dusty on Sunday, a little bit of a sleeping, about nine o'clock, ah beer, just beer, ah it was James Squire Amber Ale, this sounds like a Paris interview this does, oh I think it was, I think it was about four, four o'clock, ah no, around ten, ten o'clock, ah they headed off around 10am, no, I'm basically, I'm doing the landscaping actually, so I was doing garden edging, so you're getting the little, little charcoal bricks and cementing them into place, just a boral sand and cement mix, 20 kilo bags, considerably speedy I'd say, it's generally pretty good after around three or four hours, I wouldn't walk on it though, ah it's just a, like a grey, you know light grey, ah Magnet Mart in Gungahlin, no, no, actually drove into the work, the builder's yard, no, no, would have been around 11am, no, yep, yep, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, no comment, Nah, comment.
