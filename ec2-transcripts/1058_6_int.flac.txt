 Mm-hmm. So I woke up at about eight o'clock and I got ready and then I went into uni and spent several hours doing some uni work. So I got to uni and I grabbed some lunch and went to K17 and ate it and then I went to a lab and I was in the lab until six or six-thirty-ish doing some lab work for one of my classes. And then I went to my friend's place because they were having a cocktail speakeasy party so I got into a pretty dress and shoes at their place and drank cocktails and partied around twelve. Mmm, yes. I had toast with avocado on it. I did not. No. I had some juice. Well, I bummed around the house for a bit. I didn't leave until about ten and then it was Saturday so public transport was terrible because my mum was out so I couldn't take the car. She wasn't out? Except that I wouldn't have been able to drink at the party because I would have had to have taken the car home. Um... Ah, no, because she needed to go somewhere on Sunday. Ah, no. So what kind of... I had a lychee vodka martini and I had a couple of Bloody Marys and then just some Midori and lemonade. Ah... Ah, yeah, I made them all myself. Yep. Ah, so we all paid $20 and then the people hosting the party bought a bunch of ingredients and drink... bottles of spirits and stuff like that. The kitchen was very busy. Um, I could have. Ah, there was vodka, apple juice, lychee, lychee liqueur, um, lychee liqueur... uh, lychee juice from the lychee thing. I can't remember what else. No clue. I have no idea. Ah, there were canned lychee. Yeah. I didn't eat. I don't really like lychee. I didn't mind the taste of the martini. Yeah, I think it's the texture of lychee I don't like. I'm okay with it. Yeah, it was okay. Um, any others where you may like? I don't like bananas if they're all mushy, but I'll eat like banana bread. Yeah. But it's in bread form, so it's not... I don't like the texture of mushy bananas. And, uh, what... Um, tomato juice, um, vodka, Tabasco sauce, Worcestershire sauce, put in a bit of lemon juice, pepper, celery, stock. I really like tomato juice. Yeah. I'll just drink tomato juice and Worcestershire sauce. Tomato? How many people were at the party? Ah, about 30? And... I got my friend to pick me up from uni. Um, I asked for it. I could have. I just figured my friend was coming past anyway. So the... Yeah, yeah. So where was... Maroubra. So where was the recording screen? Yep. Would it have been... Probably would have been a bit slower. So you stayed late? Um, yeah. I was in a lab by myself. It was kind of boring. Yeah. Uh, we... the program that I needed to use was only installed on those computers. Only if I illegally download the software. Oh, I'll look... Coming into the lab. We have 24-hour access to it. You can get it done while you're in class? Yes. Um, it can be. There's plenty of class time to do it though, if I needed to. Um, I don't know. Oh, just in our labs. I, you know, spent more time on some of the earlier labs rather than the later ones. Yeah, it's lab work. Hmm? It's not an assignment. It's lab work. Why are you... Oh, it's due today. Mostly. I'm going to go to the lab after this for a bit. How long do you think... About an hour. Um, how come you didn't... Um, I was trying to do multiple lab. No. Um, I wanted to, but then I had too much work to do at work. What time is your lab? 4pm. What hour of Sunday? It shouldn't. No, no. Just one little bit to go. Well, I won't get the full marks for it. Oh, I should be okay without them. And how do you finish that stuff? Still have an exam. What do you have to do? Oh, we actually have a prac exam. Well, I'm not sure if it's a prac exam or if it's just a lab exam. So we're in a... Like, there's theory involved as well. But it is a... It isn't at the race course. It's in the CSE lab. And how do they view you when you're doing that? We don't have access to the internet. You shouldn't need to. Hmm. Not really. I should be prepared. Do you feel like doing... Uh, yeah.
