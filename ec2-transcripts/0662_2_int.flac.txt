 I can. I'll pick a nice one. I'll pick a holiday one rather than a work one. So probably I'll tell you about the one I did which was going to Europe. On the way to Europe we stopped over in Dubai and I was really interested in... I had thought I would like to work there at some point so I guess for me that trip was more about scouting out different places around the world to see what they had on offer. So when I went there I was really surprised by how the United Arab Emirates is marketed as being western friendly and I felt that it probably wasn't really quite that. But again in saying that I had chosen to live off the tourist trip I had gone and stayed over sort of not really where the tourists would hang out. So it was really, really interesting but it kind of I guess changed my thoughts on wanting to live there for any period of time. Then after leaving Dubai I really very reluctantly flew into Paris because my ex-husband at the time well he wasn't my husband at the time, really wanted to go through France and see the battlefields and I didn't want to do that and I didn't really want to be in Paris because I'd heard that the French were really arrogant and it was the complete opposite. The French were just incredible, they couldn't be more helpful. When we got off the plane at Charles de Gaulle we went and again I really love to live like a local so we didn't do the pampered tourist package, we caught the Met from the airport and I remember when we got into the centre of Paris we stopped to try and get onto the next line and we went up the wrong way and came down and we had big bags which was a big mistake that I made not realising that Europe wasn't really big bag friendly and we should have probably just taken some backpacks but we went, we were going up and down these stairs and we were exhausted and this wonderful French man came to me and said, can I carry your bag for you? And I said yes, I didn't care if he stole it, I said just take it. So he picked up my bag and he ran down the stairs and then my daughter was lugging her bag down the stairs and she was about half way down and he asked if he could take her bag as well and she was pulling at it, she didn't want him because she thought he was going to steal it and I said no, just let it go and so he took both bags, he toddled down the stairs with our bags and he got down the bottom and dropped them in a wave and said see you and off he went. It was wonderful, it was a really great thing and so I was really surprised and I went over there I'd listened to some podcasts, trying to learn a little bit of French before I went there but it's not quite like living there and living amongst the locals and you'd go to different restaurants and we'd meet people and they would teach us phrases in French which was incredibly helpful and it's funny now how sometimes there's little things that I do that I still, I wasn't there very long but I still prefer to say like excuse me, like sometimes I'll go to say excuse moi and that's not, you know, it's not English, people would probably look at you and wonder what you're doing but I did it myself because it was, yeah, it was very, very delightful spending time there and when it came time that we were going to leave, we didn't really want to leave Paris, it was so lovely but we, after Paris we went to, oh gosh, I think, yeah, Amsterdam and I was a little bit disappointed with Amsterdam I'd gone there and again, part of my scouting mission and the reason I'd chosen Amsterdam was that I'm a very, a big supporter of euthanasia and I thought if I ever got terminally ill then I'd want to probably make that choice myself so I went to Amsterdam and thought that's the last place in the world I'd want to die so it changed my outlook, I think that they, I think that Amsterdam is, I think they're quite liberal in their views and I think that they don't have many rules and I thought, you know what, that sounds like a pretty interesting kind of place to go and have a look at but the reality was that it wasn't a very nice place at all there wasn't a lot of respect and people doing whatever they want meant that they would just make it unpleasant for other people with, you know, I'm sure Amsterdam's got its own reputation but people who were high would just go around and be rowdy and problematic and yeah, so it really changed my outlook on things going there but after that we went to Belgium and went to Bruges and Bruges was something spectacular, it's this old medieval city that they've left as it was back from, you know, many centuries ago, I think they've got one modern building within the centre of Bruges and, have you been? No I haven't Oh okay, yeah, yeah I really want to go there Oh you have to do it, do you? Make sure you go to Bruges, it's often overlooked because, yeah, not being the capital but, oh my goodness, they had amazing chocolates and sweets and when we went there it was kind of more of an eating, drinking, kind of kicking back kind of an experience there but all the roads are still in the cobblestone just beautiful, really, really beautiful so I would rate that You've been there? No, I know, it's amazing, I've got a girl from Germany staying with me at the moment and she talks about their history she'll talk about things that are five or six hundred years old and see we don't have anything even warm to that No, not as old as that Exactly, and the other thing I think is that we're always pulling down our buildings, we build them and we pull them down because I don't think we really build them in a way that's really classic or timeless so we pull them down and do something else but yeah, so Bruges was really good and then I went back into Paris for a little bit and you would probably really enjoy the Moulin Rouge so if you go to Paris, make that top of your list, I think, yep, you would like that and after a couple more days in Paris we made our way home and went to Bangkok but I'd been really naughty in Paris and drinking too much and I was hungover on another plane so I wasn't doing the exercises, I wasn't walking around or doing any of that and my legs swelled up really badly and I'd only had that when I was pregnant with my daughter a long time ago so I had to just basically get into ice baths and try and bring down the swelling and they were so bad that they were tight and they hurt and I had blood vessels that were bursting in my legs, yeah, on the plane so they tried to sort of bring that down a bit so when I was in Bangkok I pretty much just stayed in a hotel the whole time just to try and recover for long enough to get back on the plane It's a shame isn't it? It is a shame, yeah, but I guess the other part of me was I got dengue fever when I was in East Timor so I have to be very careful when I travel into those regions where there's dengue carrying mosquitoes with the four different strains so I was sort of aware and a little bit concerned about that so it didn't really overly worry me because I knew that I needed to be a little bit careful I know, I'll never do it again, I tell you, I'll give myself a couple of days grace before I do it because all I wanted to do was sleep No, absolutely not, no, nothing at all, no, very much so I think the only two countries in the world are the Netherlands and Switzerland I think in the Netherlands I thought that they do perhaps a needle kind of a thing where they inject you with a needle but I think that the one in Switzerland is, it's a drink, it's a lot of different powders I think they put in there and then people have to drink it and do that so that's what I think I think that we do it for our animals, when our animals are struggling and you know they're going to die anyway and we make that choice which is a really humane choice and as a pet owner if we let our dog die in horrible pain you'd probably, I don't know, the RSPCA wouldn't be very happy with you or other people wouldn't be happy Yeah, so why as humans do we have to suffer to the end when I think that we should be able to make that choice I don't think it's too political, I think, I probably shouldn't say, I'll tell you my thoughts off tape about what I think happens in this country but I won't say it but I don't think we'll ever see it get up, I agree Yes, yes it was, oh Euro I think it is, yeah I'm trying to think back, that was back in 2006, pretty much Euro Did that make travelling easier? Absolutely, absolutely it did And Bruges? Oh I don't, I wouldn't even, gosh just incredible, the thing that I loved about the chocolates in Bruges was I think here in Australia our chocolates are too sweet whereas their chocolates over there, the chocolate and confectionery is just a hint of sweetness rather than being too overbearing, sometimes I think in Australia we'll bite into chocolate and you get that sort of almost like a tart, like it makes your mouth water a little bit whereas you don't get that, their chocolates and their sweets and everything are just very smooth and also their presentation is spectacular, in a lot of those old places they had big glass display cabinets with chocolates that were perfectly laid out, perfectly made and exactly as it should be and there was another place, I remember this beautiful chocolate place but then there was also a really magnificent lolly shop and a lot of the lollies were in pink wrappers so they had pink lights so everything was displayed and big windows, sorry big windows and big mirrors all around it so it was all reflecting and so you walked into this almost pink kind of, yeah it was gorgeous I feel it Oh good I'm glad, yeah, yeah I know, it's hard to hold back Alright well I can ask a question Yep Who did you No comment, no comment, no comment Where have you travelled No comment What month No comment Cardiff No comment The bus No comment What colour is it No comment, no comment, no comment, no comment Who was the last to Paris No comment, no comment, no comment Who was your favourite author No comment How many keys do you have in your key ring No comment Have you ever No comment, no comment
