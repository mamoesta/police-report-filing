 little bit yeah I'm trying to I'm trying to remember what I did on Saturday. Oh I oh I had a meeting in the morning that's right I got up at 9 had a shower went into uni thought I'd really be late I was two minutes late but I'm not I'm living used to uni I'm not used to having to leave you know 20 minutes beforehand when it's actually only 15 minute walk so I was like two minutes late but it turned out the other person who I was meant to meet was half an hour late there was no reception in the place we were meeting she got really annoyed she was like I called you three times no reception so we had a meeting and I got given a key to a locker so I now have access to that storage place and we just kind of looked at some of the programs I get to use in my new role yeah that was about it then after that I went home and tidied up a bit had lunch then I went out to where I normally work because my boss's girlfriend had the day before been like oh my god can you help me with my website and so I did and so that was fun I basically was setting up a WordPress site for her learning how to PHP and I'm just fiddling with stuff and that was fun and then there was a fun conversation she was like oh yeah what do you usually charge 30 an hour pick her a random number and then after that and she bought lunch which was interesting she put some kind of Thai pastry thing which I ate but was weird and then I went home I think either that or I went back to the basement at uni and hung out there cuz we don't have internet in our house yet and then went home I presume I ate food I think that might have been the night we made tortillas so we like yeah yeah I think that was a night we made tortillas we went shopping and bought meat and cooked food it was fun well dinner was tortillas we don't really have a TV yet but I think we might have watched some Terra Nova on a computer which is fun except then we finished all the episodes and they were wanting a new one we don't have internet in our house yet so we didn't really internet much but yeah probably slept 11 I think I probably went to uni after coming home and then we went shopping from uni I went work uni shopping home yeah for sure I think I met my boyfriend there cuz he went to the Apple Store yeah yeah that's that's how it worked he went to the Apple Store because whilst he keeps telling me that MacBooks are amazing his keep dying so he had to get the battery replaced so he did that while I was sitting at this person's website and then we met back at uni and then we went shopping and then we went back home and made dinner at the Aldi and the Coles along Anzac Parade no no no it's just pretty mundane gnocchi and chicken chicken breast we had a big discussion about whether to get mince or chicken breast we got chicken breast carrot and cucumber and tortillas like a 16 pack and I think we bought yeah we bought bread and probably about it bridge so we can't store anything no we surf the internet before shopping during the week I usually get up around 8 or 8.15 but and on the weekend it depends if I've got something on just me and one other girl yes she goes to uni with me so about a year half an hour no yeah got home at about 1130 and oh I stopped by IGA on the way home because I had to buy strings so we could put our mirrors up my boyfriend decided we needed to have string with a weight so we could get them vertical so stop by IGA and so I got home at 1130 and then I went out again at well 30 or 1 so I was home for an hour an hour half well 32 1 somewhere in between them now just me and my boss's girlfriend yeah three hours yes exactly people lunch I didn't mind it it was just weird it was Thai and it was weird and I hadn't had that kind of Thai before and like a pastry with meat and it was weird there's nothing wrong with it it wasn't my favorite thing ever though so I really wouldn't order it by preference I honestly have no idea could G I normally either walk or catch a bus to uni and then I catch it an m50 from uni to could well if I walk it's a 15-minute walk and then a wait for a bus because it's an m50 no timetable and then a 10-minute bus on Saturday not very long actually no it was late and I got a 370 because it was late but there was like 10 minutes it's true but Saturday I was running late so I got a bus on Saturday I went through unit in the morning so I do you need for a meeting came back caught a bus came back went home so it was there and left and then I was there left there left so three times from work I get in fifties back mm-hmm on Saturday like 20 minutes it was really late no cool no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no comment no No comment.
