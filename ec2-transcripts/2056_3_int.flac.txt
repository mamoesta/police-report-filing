 Um, yesterday I woke up at about, um, I woke up at about 5.30, um, pressed snooze on the alarm a few times, but didn't actually get up out of bed until about a quarter past six. Um, got up, had a, had some breakfast, um, just some, some toast with butter on it, so I was pretty much too tired and lazy to do anything else. Um, then I had a shower, um, got ready to sort of walk out the house, catch the bus, and then I noticed my sister, who usually leaves a lot earlier than me, was still getting ready for work, so I asked her if I could get a lift to work, and she said yes. She only works around the corner at Spring Hill. Um, so basically just hopped in the car with her, um, she dropped me just in the city, just off George Street, um, then I walked the rest of the way, um, got into the building at about 20 past seven, I think it was, um, just went straight to my office, um, went and got changed, then usually basically sat around for about 15 minutes, um, just, you know, contemplating whether I was actually going to go through and spend the rest of the day there, or whether I could just turn around and go home, you know, another five minutes there, just thinking of what excuses I could use to go home, but I couldn't find any because I was basically just too tired, brain wasn't working enough, uh, so I went downstairs and got a coffee, um, had to wait down there for quite a while, about 15 minutes, because for some reason there was a hold-up, I think the coffee machine down there wasn't working or something, but didn't really worry me, um, so then I didn't really get to my office until about a quarter past eight, sat down, stared at the screen for about an hour, not really doing anything, just having my coffee, um, then Ross got into work, so I just sat there and talked to him for a little while, again, just pretending that I was trying to do some work, um, and just trying to think, oh, I went and did some scanning, went out just to where we have our scanners where all the 10 prints come in and just scan them for a while, I don't mind doing the scanning because it lets you just not really think about anything, you sit there, play on your phone for a while while you're waiting everything to go through, don't have to worry about answering phones, so it's a bit of a relief, um, and at 11 30, um, I called up a guy I used to work with down on the second floor to see if we wanted to go have lunch, um, so I went down there, spoke to him for a while, then we walked up to 400 George Street, get some lunch, um, I ordered the Hokkien noodles and Thai stir-fry and just straight with vegetables, um, you know, I basically just got into the habit of doing that from when I was a vegan, um, but, you know, I've just been slack and lazy with it, but I still, it's one thing I do get, um, then walked back to the office, just sat down there and ate lunch down there, um, I don't usually eat lunch with, um, the guys in the office I'm working with now because the lunch room's too small, everyone's basically in there just talking shit and it gets annoying, so I like to actually go in and have a chat with some people I'm actually friends with, I'm just getting a little bit bitter and nasty, but anyway, um, then I went back, just had to go through a whole heap of purchasing, so I went and put that through, there's a heap going on at the moment because it's end of financial year, everyone's trying to spend all the money they can because, you know, there's about 60 grand or something they need to spend and then if they don't get to spend it then they basically lose it for next year, um, so that's basically all I'm going to be doing for the next six weeks, um, so yeah, went, did that all the way through, I went home at 3.30, um, basically just because I didn't really feel like staying around for the rest of the day, um, so I had to catch the bus because although my sister drops me off in the morning she doesn't finish until about five o'clock, so I just walked to Queen Street and catch the bus from there, um, found out while I was looking there that my bus is going to be cut down as part of this big restructuring of the bus system, so now that, you know, they only come about every 10 minutes for, you know, one key hour, um, they're cutting that down as well so there's only going to be about two every hour, which means people are going to be standing up every time but there's nothing you can really do about that, um, so when I got home I was pretty well just that tired from the day that just sat on the couch, watched some TV and didn't really move until the rest of the day, um, yeah, that's about it, that was pretty much my day, oh yeah, yeah, that's right, oh, just snoozing, I basically just didn't want to wake up yet, um, I only had two pieces of toast because I don't really eat too much in the morning, um, yeah, I was pretty much just close to walking out the door, yeah, it only takes about 15 minutes to drive in as opposed to if I catch the bus it can easily be 45, yeah, um, I can a little earlier, um, basically I can arrive anywhere between about seven and eight, um, any earlier than that and, you know, it's just not really kosher, uh, I just got a cappuccino, no, no, I'll usually walk up and have it at the office because it usually comes out way too hot, um, basically all of the the 10 prints, um, from all over the state, so whenever people get, um, printed whether it's via the life scan machines or via actual ink on paper, um, they all come into headquarters in the fingerprint bureau, so that has, they have to be basically put through, they get checked against a national database or, you know, state database, um, to see whether they've used an alias, whether they've been printed before, all of that sort of thing, um, and then once they do they actually get scanned, um, and then put onto the forensic register, um, which is on the, yeah, basically, um, QPS intranet, um, so anyone from the state can get on and just have a look, um, scanning one set of prints would only take a matter of a minute if, if not more, so usually we'll actually scan them in bunches of about 10 and you always have two machines constantly running, so, um, I probably would have scanned close to, I'd say, 200, um, we take it in turns, we have a roster of who does it because like anything that we do over there, there's so many mundane tasks that if you just had one person doing it all day every day you'd basically go insane, burn out, and then leave, um, so I'll just basically wait until there's a certain time during the day on my rostered day and do them all at once. Um, there's just a little, um, there's a little noodle place, I think it's called, um, you know, Asian Box or Box and Bowl or something like that, uh, yeah, I go there quite a bit, um, I used to go there when I was vegan because it was easy, um, you know, Chinese food, Indian food, it's always easy to get vegan and vegetarian, um, options and plus all the girls that were working there at the time, they basically recognized me and knew my order so I could just go up and basically order straight away, so it made me feel a little bit special to go there and be known. No, I, I sort of fell off the wagon around Christmas time, just too many beers, too much ham, um, and I just didn't really go back to it. Um, I was vegetarian for about a year and a half and I was vegan for probably about eight months of that towards the end. Um, yeah, it was just a health choice, um, basically, after I'd gotten really sick for the last couple years working, I basically decided to try different diets to see if that would work and that I found worked really well. Um, there was no moral choice in it whatsoever, I mean, I've got leather boots on my feet right now, so, um, funnily enough, it was fairly easy to do, um, you know, looking at a plate of steak or bacon or something like that, it, once you get over it, it's basically done, you're over it, you don't really care for it much, but it, it's a matter of habit, you know, you eat all that meat by habit and then you stop doing it by habit and I've basically just sort of gone into doing it again by habit. Um, probably not, it depends, at the moment I don't feel too bad, um, and it's good just, just being able to go to a restaurant and order whatever you want, um, you know, because it can be a bit more of a hassle for, for other people, you know, when you're going out, they always think, oh, where can we go, um, you know, that Phil can eat something, so I'll definitely, I'll cut back a lot in my own time, but if I'm going out to restaurants, I just order whatever, I don't really care. Uh, yeah, that's right, um, anything that needs to be, um, used throughout the Bureau, whether it comes from just basic stationery, um, whether it's chemicals for the lab, um, you know, anything that the, the guys in the photo suite need, whether it be cameras, film, that sort of stuff. When it comes to the stationery, I have a look to see what's needed and then I'll go through and, and purchase on the numbers that I know are going to be used, but for everything else, especially with the photo lab, um, or even just the regular labs down there, other people take care of that and then just give me a list of what I need to put through. Uh, yeah, the rest of the afternoon after lunch. Um, you don't usually have to wait too long because they come every 10 minutes or so, at the times where I'm catching them, so the worst case scenario, if you just miss one, it's only going to be 10 minutes. Yeah, they're going to be changing that, which is just going to screw everything up. Yeah, they've always been busy, um, I mean, when I was in high school, I basically caught the same buses because I've always lived in the same area, um, you know, they were fine, they came once every half an hour and, you know, there was always room, whereas now they come every, you know, every 10 minutes in the peak hours of the morning and afternoon and you're standing up most of the time. Oh, it's going to get to the point where buses are just going to go straight past bus stops because they can't pick anyone up. Um, I was just basically flicking through, um, everything. My office have got this, it's kind of like a pay TV system that runs through the internet called Fetch TV or Dog TV or something like that, um, and it's got a few extra channels like, you know, National Geographic, um, you know, MTV and TLC and stuff like that. So, I usually just have a look at all the travel shows, just tend to be on somewhere else. Uh, yeah, um, I can't remember what I had for dinner, actually. It must have been all that wine I was drinking, pretty much just salted out of my memory. Sorry about that.
