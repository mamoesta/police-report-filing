 Coolness! Yay! Saturday. I slept in. I got up at like 10.30, which was awesome. Then I had a shower. Then I... Oh, I had a friend over. That's right. She stayed over Friday night. So we all went shopping around 12. And we got like ridiculous amounts of food. And we got pancake mix and milk. It's an important thing because I don't have a fridge. So if we want milk, we have to go buy milk. So we actually had cereal and pancakes. And then I called my boyfriend at 1.30. And then I left. Oh, and then we watched Starcraft. And then I left the house at 2.30 to go back to see my parents, pick up my siblings up. So I got there just before 4. And then I stayed there till about 5.30. Then we went back to the station and I got on a train at quarter to six. We had to wait at Chatswood for 13 minutes. And then we got back to my place at like 20 past seven. And then we had stir-fry for dinner, which my little sister made. And we rearranged the living room. So we put the TV over by the window and moved everything around and broke the leg of the sofa bed. It was fun. And then we watched The Lion King 2 and 3. By the time we finished all that, it was midnight. And so they went to sleep because they didn't have to work. No, I mean, I don't have to get up super early, but I don't normally get to sleep until 10. I normally get up at 8. Between 10.30 and 12, I had a shower and checked my email and made a shopping list and talked about how we should go shopping for about half. And then went shopping. I do not remember. 73. Probably about half of them unanswered. Probably about five. We caught a bus. We got, we walked over to the further bus stop and we got a 39 something. Three? Yeah, to Maroubra. Aldi. And then Coles. No. Well, I mean, we saw people, but no one we knew. We found Waterchestnut and Coles. It was pretty exciting. It was pretty much my life. Lemon Lime Bitters Cordial was on special. My friend and one of my housemates. Yeah, uni this year. Reasonably, yeah. Because they came in on Friday night because they were bored and then we were up till one and they didn't want to go home and I have a sofa bed. Yeah, one of the legs. It's not exactly a hard fix. It's just one of the dowel joints snapped. So we have to go buy some more and just replace them. So we need pliers as well. Nah, it should be fine. I think it might have been damaged already, but when you fold it up and fold it out, the leg sometimes drags on the floor. So I think it was just a gradual process. Exactly. We got back about quarter past one. No, we caught the bus. Yeah. No, we each had a backpack and a bag and we caught a bus. Five minutes or so. No, we caught an M10. Yes, they're exciting. They have Wi-Fi hotspots on them. Not this time. No, we got back just about 1.15. So we probably left just after one. Yeah, left house about 12. Yeah, 45 minutes. Probably. Yeah, no. Yeah, yeah. 1.30. 25 minutes or so. No, I caught the train down or the bus and then the train. Not long. Couple of minutes. Yeah. Um, not long. I timed it pretty well so they didn't have a long wait, like five minutes or something. No. No, it's a Saturday. No, it was pretty empty. It was pretty empty. It was about 50 minutes. Yeah, I got picked up at the station. Uh, yeah, I phoned when I got on the train. Five minutes. It's pretty close. Not really. I didn't have much time, so it's gonna be quicker. No, um, we got driven back to the station, caught a train back and then a bus back. No, this was my siblings. No, I picked them up. So they came. Yeah, yeah, they came back with me. No. City rail, actually not as bad as everyone say they are. Usually pretty good. 3.93. Maybe. My sister made it. No. No, we didn't. No, I just forgot about them. 2 and 3. Well, 2 wasn't bad, 3 was just terrible. My siblings wanted 2. 9 and 11. Yeah, something like that. Uh, well, I've only moved out a couple weeks ago, so this is the first time because it's the start of school holidays, but I'm not sure. Yeah, probably. Cool. No comment. No comment. No comment.
