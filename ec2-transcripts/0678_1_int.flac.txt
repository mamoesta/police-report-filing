 I went to Fiji last March. Yeah. I went there for a friend's wedding. I was the photographer for her. Spent a few days. Five all up. First it was Qantas to Sydney and then it was... Oh, is it Fiji Airlines? Aye. Yep. It was good. Yep. Right at the back. Back section and I was in the middle of the back section. I did... Wouldn't have a clue. I highly doubt it. Yeah. Yeah. No. Top of the camera. I use a Canon 5D Mark II. I took a 70-200mm. A 17-24mm macro. And a 16-35mm. Nadi Airport. Nandi. Nadi. I don't know how you pronounce that. About half an hour. Oh, I was off to... You know where all the resorts are? Around... Yeah. Where all the resorts... Yeah. They're all sort of together. No idea. It was a Saturday. About 70. Remember what? They had a mix-up with the wedding song. It started off with an ACDC one and went into... Oh, I can't remember his name. Yeah. Oh, she took it in a stride. Mark. It was around the 14th, I think. 15th. Have you ever been out? I've been to New Zealand. I flew into Auckland. I've been there a couple of times. Last time was with my friend for schoolies. We flew into Auckland and we stayed on the North Island and just took some bus trips around there. Remember what? We went to Rotorua. And that's probably the only other place besides Auckland we went. Rotorua. We went to the Waitomo Glowworm Cave. And that was very exciting. We went to the spa and probably about it. The cave? No, at the spa. They have a little village area around there as well. That's when they did the display welcome. They dress up in their traditional dress, do their little dancey thing, come up and do the nose to nose. And yep. Yep. Can you recall the last time? Yes, that was last Thursday. Commonwealth. No, I'm a bit worried about that, I must say. Not necessarily. When you're drunk, I can understand why you need that. Yeah. Oh no, I wasn't actually. No, no. What was the last pub? Kennedy Room. Yep. Remember any of the bar stuff? Wouldn't have a clue. I had a, I didn't order it, paid for it, some sort of cocktail. No idea. The Durham? That's probably all I know about Kingston. Cream Cafe. I did. I have a mocha. No idea. $4 something. So you're a big... No, no. Every now and then I have a craving. When was the last time? Oh, it was yesterday. Number six, Caltex. Montana? No. Do you usually park at Top Park? Yeah, about 7.30. I have. That was when I was late to work and I parked in the parking area, the pay parking area. Yep. And I didn't have enough change on me, so yes. Just your luck? Oh, it's my own fault, I suppose. It was 79 or 81 it is. Yeah. Yeah, it's ridiculous. It's, yeah. I personally have just the one camera, one camera body, or two camera bodies. The other one is redundant, so I don't really count it. No, I'm just kidding. Yeah. Everything's just backwards to, it's hard to learn again. Yeah. Although I must say the new Nikon D800 is fantastic and I'd probably turn for it. That's a difficult question. I find it very difficult to pinpoint one thing as a favourite. Yeah. Yeah. Went out to photograph. Oh, I do it every day for the job. Yes, yesterday I went to Mort Street to take photos. Yeah. A Hyundai gets. Automatic, no, I have. It was better than I thought it was going to be. Didn't bunny hop too much. Have you ever ran a red light? Yes. I was in Toowoomba on Christmas night. I was tired. Yeah. Stopped at a green, straight through. I've also stopped at a green light before, so I think that evens it out. No comment, no comment, no comment, no comment. Dave.
