# police-report-filing

Recently, I've been very interested in the opportunity of LLM to convert semi-structured audio conversation to a useful structured object. Recent improvements to audtio --> text models may enable more opporunities like this (recent Whisper v2 improvements). This first iteration focuses on the ability to extract relevant information from police-style interviews, to demonstrate the ability to automate the administration and reporting of non-violent crimes (petty theft and larceny).

* Whisper to convert audio to text
* Various LLMs (open source and GPT) for zero-shot entity extraction

TODO:
* Fine-tune an LLM to police transcripts
* Refine the TAM and business case to determine a novel application.
